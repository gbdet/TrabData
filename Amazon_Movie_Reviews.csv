I would have preferred some more details in the description of what you get in each package, and I hope that amazon does a better job seperating reviews from product to product as some of the reviews DO NOT apply to the 4kUHD set.

  I really wish Amazon kept all the reviews separate for each format on movies so it was easier to read about the specific version I want to buy.  I'm not going to review the movies.  This review is just for the collection itself, and what's included.  More importantly, what's not included.  If you are buying this 4K collection only for the movies, you will not be disappointed.  This is the best way to see and hear the movies.  They look amazing and sound even better.  However, I was surprised when I opened the box and saw only 16 discs, 8 for the 4K editions and 8 for the Blu Ray editions.  If you were to buy the 4K movies individually, you get an additional 3rd disc which is where all the extras are.  That 3 disc is not included for any of the movies in this collection.  There are no extras included with this collection, except for one each on the Blu Ray edition; the in-movie experience.  I previously owned the Blu Ray Ultimate editions, and I was really disappointed that the documentaries found on there are no where to be found in this collection.  No additional scenes.  Nothing.  In addition, the previous Extended versions of The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber of Secrets are only available on the Blu Ray discs.  The 4K disc only contains the Theatrical version.  Had I known this before I bought, I would have waited for better 4K box set, or bought all the movies individually.

  *** UPDATE *** I returned this very disappointing set of DVD's  and DID RECEIVE A FULL REFUND.  I've never once had a bad Amazon experience until today. I received a set of burnt DVDs, the film quality was grainy. I was super bummed. Hoping to return them for a refund. Just praying I don't get ""burnt"" while doing so.

  This review is about the set, not the movies. You either like Harry Potter or you don't. I assume that only the former is looking at this set.Ok, THIS is how a boxed set should be. I've read some horror stories about other sets being mis-matched discs from previous releases (the X-Men collections) and I've seen the beauty that is The Lord of the Rings Extended Edition boxed set (another thing of beauty.) A truly cohesive production with original artwork on every disc. (When was it decided that Blu-ray discs didn't need artwork?)In truth, I have only just opened the set and have not even inserted one disc into my player. But I wanted to post something now to get one piece of info out there... How to get your digital copy!I'd read reviews about the codes being expired, so didn't have any expectations. Having bought the set at less than half price on Black Friday, I didn't care. But, since the code was in my hand, I figured why not try.The original provider of these codes was Flixster. They have been out of the Ultraviolet business for about a year now. Vudu filled their spot. A very good change, since the Vudu interface on all my hardware blows away what Flixster used to have. So I went to Vudu.com, but no love there. Received a message that the code had expired. Had to try. Then I did a little digging on the web and someone suggested going straight to Ultraviolet's web site, myuv.com. At first it didn't look promising, until I noticed down in the lowest left corner of the screen that there was a link to ""Redeem Code."" I entered my code, the screen took a moment, then said I'd have to go to Vudu to complete my registration of my code. I thought it was just sending my to Vudu's main screen and that it hadn't worked. No, it directed me to a confirmation screen that the movies had been added to my collection. I've since signed back into my account, and there they are.

  Got this last year for my mom for Christmas as she is an HP fan too. It took her a while to start watching them but she showed me them this year and I didn’t realize that all the discs look burned and even one of the movie’s disc’s looking completely different. But the biggest negative was that it was missing Half Blood Prince entirely instead having two copies of Order of the Phoenix

  The discs in this ‘set’ are all very different. It looks like they took discs from several versions and put them together in one case. These are not part of a set at all. The disc images are noticeably inconsistent and the case material feels cheap and easily breakable. If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want a real movie set then please DON’T BUY this one!! I’m very disappointed with this purchase. The pictures show how different the discs are.

  Delayed audio and inconsistent packaging! Wanted to enjoy the Harry Potter movies, but the product itself seems subpar in comparison to other DVD collection products (e.g. LOTR). The DVD collection seems to be a Frankenstein of other individually packaged movies (i.e. The disc for The Half-Blood Prince says “Disc 1 Movie” as if it comes from a 2-DVD set). Most importantly, the audio in the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was severely delayed for a good 20-30 minutes of the movie. I have not seen Part 2 yet, so I can’t vouch for that movie, but movies 1-6 were fine. Lastly, as someone who needs/enjoys subtitles, HP 1-6 do NOT have a DVD menu screen, so you don’t have an option to turn them on. Overall, I enjoy and love Harry Potter, but this disc set was much less than what I had hoped for.

  Just watched the first disk and the 4K UHD is a vast improvement. Overall color correction and improvement over the Blu Ray versions. The atmos soundtrack was fabulous! 100% improvement and imservasive. My 5.1.4 system provided a fantastic addition. Sound moving all around and the announcer during the quiddach match was right overhead. A great experience. If the other disks sound and look this good it was a great buy. Very well done.

  Although the box was shrink wrapoed and purported to be new the disks enclosed were all clearly bottleg copies. The titles on the disks were not centered with some of the titles trailing off the sides of the disk. There were smudges and knicks on some of the disks as well. I chose this set because it was ranked as ""Amazons Choice"" in Harry Potter DVDS. I am very happy I did nkt give this as a gift.

  This review is for the 2017 release of the 8-film collection on 4K Blu-Ray. I don't think the difference between blu-ray and 4k is very extreme. If you own the whole set on blu-ray, I don't think you need to buy it on 4K as well. However, if you're like me, who didn't own the full set, it might be worth it to invest in the 4k set.Tip: the 4k set comes with the full blu-ray (not 4k) set. I was able to split the cost with a friend and send her the blu-ray set, while I kept the 4k. They are packaged in separate cases as well, which made it convenient.

  Discs 3 & 4 were scratched enough to have to miss significant chunks of the movies and disc 5 wouldn’t even play in the DVD player. It’s no wonder the price is so low on this set. They are TERRIBLE. The return window should be longer than a month when there are 8 discs to go through.

  Very disappointing. I ordered these to watch them with my little sister over the weekend and DVD 1 was skipping throughout the entire movie, DVD 2 was fine, DVD 3 was skipping throughout the entire movie and towards the last 40 minutes of the movie it go so bad we just gave up watching it and didn't get to see the end. I am returning the set and ordered another. I hope the new set doesn't have the same problem.

   Some people were saying they got burnt copies or that the collection appeared to be completed from different sets because all the discs seemed different. Or they got the version thats says ""the philosopher's stone"" which is the European version I believe but I got mine within 2 days completely new and in great shape. All the discs work and they are all from the same set. Usually see the entire collection for up to $90 at the store so as soon as I saw the whole thing for just $35 I didn't even hesitate to buy them. Worth my money for sure

  I like Harry Potter but I'm not a DVD/Blu-Ray expert.  That said, I thought this set was comprehensive and really much, much more than I'll ever watch.I just wanted to post a comprehensive set of pictures to let people who are considering this set exactly what they're getting.PRESENTATION:  The slipcase is heavy cardboard, very sturdy.The discs are bound in a wide-format book, one year/movie per page, three to four discs per year/movie.  The  SLIPCASE IS NEARLY A FOOT WIDE and will NOT fit on a shelf like a standard dvd/blu-ray.DISCS:  DVD, BluRay, and Ultraviolet (or movies anywhere or vudu or whatever) digital code for ALL 2d movies  Discs with extra features, varies by ""year.""  3D blu-rays for ONLY THE LAST TWO MOVIES, deathly hallows 1&2 (3D digital code NOT part of the set)VALUE:  Well, if you're a fan then this is a very nice set, and the sky's the limit with ""value,"" right? :)I purchased during a Black Friday sale from Amazon for nearly half-off, and at that price was worth it.  Full price, well, there are fans for that but not me.

  Amazing set but just some info to think about.  Only the 1st 2 films are true 4K because they were scanned off the 35mm masters.  The rest of the movies were filmed in 2K so I imagine they had some kind of upscaling applied to them.  Also the discs support HDR but the digital downloads support Dolby Vision.

  A few of the disks were very problematic... Not just freezing and failing to play or showing pixilated screens, but the dubbing was bad on a few of them. The mouths and the words just didn't line up all the time and it was distracting. Why do collections like these always seem inferior to the individual releases?

  I found that a lot of the other reviews for this product were a little confusing. I am writing this review because of that reason. I was terrified of ordering this and it not being what I thought it was. I am sooo glad I did order it! This is a product for the hard core Harry Potter fan!!! This is going to, hopefully, be a short, sweet, and to the point review. The review is also of the product itself; not a review of all the movies and special features like so many people of put on here.To clarify, this product is the ""Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection DVD+Blu-Ray"" Amazon option ""Multi-format"" version (I think it is selling for around $150 right now...I got it for $90 as a Black Friday, or was is Cyber Monday?, special!)Included in this Box set:Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:  1.

  Great collection.The annoying part is the digital redemption.  The insert goes to Ultraviolet, which tells you to use Flixster, which then leads you to Vudu.  Flixster died over a year ago and it's confusing.The correct way to redeem the digital copies is to use use Movies Anywhere and redeem the code on that platform (either the website or the app.)  No need to deal with Vudu, Flixster, UV, whatever.  Worked great Christmas Day 2017.

  The disks skip while watching them. There are no scratches so I am not sure why. They are poor quality. We tried to go back and watch a part and it skipped again and again so we miss that part of the movie. Disappointing.

  The 8-disc Blu-ray collection is missing the high-quality audio. To get the DTS-HD MA audio you have to buy the individual Special Edition Blu-ray edition of each movie. There's no point in buying the 8-disc collection. You save a little bit but miss the full enjoyment of the movies and all of the extra material.This is also not the ""complete"" collection. The first two movies were released with added footage as Extended versions. These easily fit together with the shorter versions on the same disc. In fact they both versions are on one disc in the Special Edition set.The loss in audio quality needs to be made clear in the listing. The missing Extended versions for the first two movies also needs to be clearly stated, and this 8-disc box set should not be labeled ""Complete"".If you want to get the extended versions of the first two movies, that add $20 to the cost of this box set. It is exactly the same cost to get the individual Special Edition versions of every movie, plus you get a significant amount of special features.

  So lockdown happened. And the hubs and I decided to return to Hogwarts to kill a couple of days. Turns out, four of the eight DVD/blu rays I had were beyond scratched up (thanks ex!) And despite having access to HULU, HBO, DISNEY+ and like every other movie channel thingie, couldn't find any of the Harry Potter Movies without having to buy them digitally.  Considering I've bought movies digitally on Prime AND HAVE HAD THEM REVOKED (thanks Amazon!) I was NOT doing that again, so I insisted on something more concrete. After searching for what felt like days, we stumbled across this little set but was wary.  Too good of a deal and there wasn't a lot of reviews. NOT SURE WHY this set is amazing! All movies played brilliantly and it is compact. So instead of having a  half a foot of movies taking up space, we have a small one-inch box with all the movies inside, blu-ray, and all and fantastic quality. So... if you need a copy of all the movies, This is the way I would suggest going!

  I received the Harry Potter Complete 8-Film DVD set today and have just checked the discs. Four of the eight DVDs are scratched. I will play them to see if the scratches have affected them, but am shocked at the poor quality of the set.7/3/19 UPDATE: We have now watched the DVDs. I believe these DVDs are not original studio content. I can’t help but wonder if they’re pirated/burned copies. Four of the DVDs froze up and had glitches. One simply wouldn’t play. Some of the disks, when played, show the name of the movie, and ""Disc 1.” Additionally, They are edited down (I saw additional content when the movies were aired on TV). I ordered and returned a couple sets because so many of the DVDs had issues. I had to replace them with the individual studio versions.

  OKAYYYYYY I bought this movie set 3 years ago (I know, long time ago, whatever). I swear I've watched it all, and maybe my college-self just never fully paid attention. But this weekend, all my sister and I wanted to do was watch Prisoner of Azkaban. We were so excited! Put the movie in, and guess what started playing... POLAR EXPRESS. You can imagine our confusion. So now, I am left with a DVD of Polar Express that I would do anything to trade for Prisoner of Azkaban. So angry.

  Ravenclaw here ;)I got the 8 disc set and everything works perfectly. There are previews before the main menu on disc 3, 7 and 8. From some bad reviews I saw saying that disc 3 was polar express, I decided to take my chance. It was just a polar express preview before the main menu with a few others. DVDs all used to have previews (or ads as some might say) and they are skippable so idk what the big deal is.I was craving to watch this and get me through a stressful time so I watched all the discs immediately after I got the set yesterday. They run perfectly. There were no scratches. They smell brand new. For only 40 bucks, it's worth a shot to see if it will work. And it did. :p just finished the last disc and havent taken it out of the dvd player to put it back in the case. Any sensible fan would buy this here instead of wasting money trying to buy it somewhere else. Good quality.

  Pretty disappointed with this set. The interior of the box set was damaged so the discs kind of hang in there in their places. A few discs were not in their holding and several arrived with scratches/scuffs. The discs don't sit well in the plastic holding. The discs also don't look like the picture provided in the ""from the manufacturer"" section. That image shows movie characters featured on the discs, however, the set received is plain silver discs with black printed lettering for labels. For the sale price, I'll be trying to get a replacement through Amazon and hope that the next set is better.

  Doesn't seem like its real 4k...Specifically in the goblet of fire, right after Dumbledore announces that the Triwizard tournament has begun, the next scene is from outside of Hogwarts and zooms in... but it looks severely out of focus (blurry). I'll have to watch the Blu-ray to see if its just an issue that has been there in every version of the movies, but even aside from that the picture quality just doesn't seem noticeably better than bluray, which normally I do notice an improvement when I compare a 4k to a Blu-ray.And yes, I do have a UHD 4k tv. However, I was using my Xbox One S to play it. So maybe the issue is with my player. In any case, I'll update this if I find something other than the discs themselves to be the cause.Update, just finished watching up to the half blood prince and it seems to be the only one that looks like 4k. But even in the half blood prince, there are choppy parts. Overall this seems to be a poor and premature attempt at 4k and will need to be redone. At this point you will be better off purchasing each of the HP movies individually on 4k rather than this set. I do not believe that ive gotten a bootleg copy, unless it is just a very well made bootleg set. But in half blood prince, the menu is different than the previous movies, so that seems odd.

  First off, please note that when you buy the cheaper, 8-disc Blu-ray or DVD set, these will not include any ""Disc 2"" of any of the movies. In other words, it's movies-only, and whatever special features are on the main movie disc. I understood this when I made the purchase - no qualms there.That said, ""cheaper"" should not mean ""haphazardly put together by trolls."" The disc quality is mediocre at best (if you're lucky enough to get original discs and not burned copies, as some have reported!). My Prisoner of Azkaban disc doesn't even work! I get a repeated ""Cannot read media"" error message from my PS4 and PS3.If you're a big Harry Potter fan (and film collector or aficionado), you're almost better off buying each individual Blu-ray special edition. If you're going with this 8-disc cheap version, cross your fingers and your toes that you actually get 8, high-quality discs!

  Love these movies and this was a great price for Black Friday. So I just opened the case and one of the discs had come out of its spot. Huge gouges on that one. As I looked through the rest, there were finger prints on the top of one of the discs???!!! Huh? So I checked each disk. There were scratches on almost every one of them. I’ve been buying elsewhere lately and came back to Amazon. This is the second “ new” item I’ve bought that turned out not to be new. So disappointing!!! I hope I can get this at the same price. If I can’t, that will be sad because I love these movies!!!UPDATE: Will return this. These are burned copies of the original movie. It blows me away that this was a Black Friday deal and they’re pirated!  Like others have said, the quality is poor in the DVDs and on the Prisoner of Azkaban, it starts off playing The Polar Express. Seriously ?? I just can’t believe that Amazon would sell burned ( pirated) movies. This was sold by a seller but was fulfilled by Amazon so yes, they have something to do with it. So bummed. I love these movies and can not afford another 8 movie collection from another seller for this price.

  I got the 8 disc Blu-Ray set. Well, it works for watching all the movies, Ill give that, but if you are hoping for some beautiful cohesive set to give as a gift, the blu ray set is not it. It’s a mish-mash of discs that seem to have been ripped out of the original releases. There is no flow in the artwork, they just seem to be literally whichever disc from the original release had the movie, torn out of the old case and slapped into a new case with a picture of Hogwarts on the front and room enough for 8 discs. I mean... if literally all you want is to have all of the movies available to you, this works. If you were hoping that by 9 years (yes, we are that old) after the release of the final film installment, there would be an official, cohesive, single format release of all the harry potter movies in a box set... well, I haven’t seen one. It may exist, but this certainly isn’t it.

This set has 8 4kUHD blu-ray discs, and 8 standard blu-ray discs.The 4k blu-ray discs DO NOT contain any special features, I checked each disc.The standard blu-ray discs DO contain some special features as follows:Disc 1 (Sorcerer's Stone) has in movie experience with chris columbus and BD-Live, and includes the 159 minute length movie.Disc 2 (Chamber of Secrets) has in movie experience with chris columbus and BD-Live, and includes the 174 minute length movie.Disc 3 (Azkhaban) BD-liveDisc 4 (Goblet of Fire) has in movie experience and BD-live.Disc 5 (Order of Pheonix) has in movie experience, focus points and BD-live.Disc 6(Half-Blood Prince) has maximum movie mode, focus points and BD-live.Disc 7(Deathly Hallows 1) has maximum movie mode, focus points and BD-live.Disc 8(Deathly Hallows 2) has maximum movie mode, focus points and BD-live.""

  I bought the 31 disc Hogwarts collection. The set is beautifully packaged. I admit I may never end up using the discs because it comes with a digital code. The code says it expired in 2016, but it says it has been extended until 2019. Once redeemed, it does not expire. I could not redeem it through Flixster or Vudu, but it did work on movies anywhere and now all of the movies show up in my Amazon Video account.

  Assuming that most people ready to spend over $100 on a ""Harry Potter"" box set already know and appreciate what a great film series it is, I'm going to confine my review to the Hogwarts Collection 31-disc box set, which is equally excellent, and in my opinion an essential buy for any true Potter fanAs a committed ""Potter"" fan since 2002, I of course already own films 1-8 on both DVD and Blu-ray. But as someone who finds the special features of films equally as interesting as the films themselves, I was so excited to find this set, as it is essentially a more affordable repackage of 2011's now-discontinued ""Ultimate Editions,"" and features an embarassment of riches special-feature-wise.Unlike the $40 Harry Potter Blu-ray box set, this set includes both the DVD, Blu-ray, and digital versions of each film, the latter of which I was able to redeem via MoviesAnywhere even after the supposed expiration date of December 31, 2019. Films 1 and 2 include the Extended versions with the deleted scenes added back in, while 7 and 8 have 3D Blu-ray versions as well. The sound and video quality of the Blu-rays are excellent, and are a vast improvement over the original DVDs and single-disc Blu-rays.But it's the special features that really make this set. Along with the original bonus features ported over from the initial DVD releases, each film comes with a bonus disc packed with several excellent behind-the-scenes television documentaries from both Britain and America that were aired to promote the films and to my knowledge have never been shown again. Each bonus disc also includes one part of the fantastic exclusive 8-part documentary,""Creating the World of Harry Potter,"" which covers a specific topic such as creature effects, music, characters, etc., using behind-the-scenes archive footage from all eight fims, and really gives you an appreciation for all the work that went into bringing the Wizarding World to life.Now, for the packaging. As the owner of three now-discontinued ""Ultimate Editions"" of the Potter films, I have to say this Hogwarts Collection is a lot more compact. Unlike those bulky, heavy boxes, the discs are held in what is essentially an album that reminds me of the photo album Hagrid gives to Harry at the end of ""Sorcerer's Stone."" While I don't usually like cardboard sleeves, in this case, it's a great way to store 31 discs in a relatively secure package that doesn't require a shelf of its own! I also like that the album fits into a sturdy cardboard slipcase, which I think will really keep the discs safe in the long-run.While most Potter fans probably own several editions of each film, the exclusive bonus features and compact presentation make this a great set to add to your collection, and one that I highly recommend.

  This review is on the blu-ray 16 disk 2016 edition. This product came two days early and is as described. It has all the bonus features like I wanted and looks really good.  The problem is that the movie and bonus feature menus are in Spanish. I speak Spanish so this is not the end of the world, but it is annoying and could be a lot worse for people who do not. The movies are still in English and have English subtitles but traversing the menu screen could be hard.

  I'm a true Harry Potter fan...been to Harry Potter world..my patronus is a peacock, I'm in the Slytherin house (but don't let that deter you from this review..we're not all so bad) and I want to clear things up, because there's so many different reviewsShort version: A LITTLE SKETCHY BUT 10/10 WOULD RECCOMEND AND THEY PLAY GREAT ..I'M VERY PLEASED (will update if I notice any issue)I'll start with the packaging. I purchased this set on black friday of 2018 for around $23 I believe. The packaging looks great, it's wrapped and nothing about the packaging or discs appear used to me (no scratches, smudges or wear, etc), and I play video games so I'm pretty picky about the conditions of my discs. There is 1 disc per movie, unlike the other thirty some disc sets I've seen on here. As of my purchase in 2018, they are in a great convenient typical DVD box set with a cardboard-like slip cover sleeve/case for it. All discs are in 1 plastic case. It's on the less expensive side for a complete film collection, but it's definitely sturdy and will do the job. All plastic, no cardboard sleeves like I've seen with other collections..I believe these are ""bootleg"", but they're very good ones. If you don't mind that being a possibility, then I'd highly, highly recommend them to you. All of my movies worked just fine, no skips, no glitches or anything wrong with the language or wording not matching up. The picture quality looks ""normal"". ..not grainy or pixelated at all, but I'm not sure they're HD..I just don't know, but they're no different than the movies I already have (I have all the movies, but wanted them in a convenient set too).So far I've spent all night testing them, so I've watched at least 20-30 mins of each movie tonight, so I haven't finished them all but I'm so please so far!Some other reviews really freaked me out.. especially the one about the Polar Express instead of the Prisoner of Azkaban ..There are some small funky quirks. I think the Prisoner of Azkaban must be burned off the polar Express disc or something..I'm not sure..to be honest the first 10- 20 seconds or so was the Polar Express movie, but then it went into the Harry Potter disc menu just fine lol.The only inconsistency I've noticed with the packing is that all of the actual DVDs are silver with black writing, but one (The Goblet of Fire) has gray text with black outline instead of all black, but everything else looks the same. To me, these things are very very minimal. This is shown in the photo I have takenOverall, I'm SO pleased with my purchase and I'm going to get a lot of joy out of these! I gave four stars because of the quirks and subtle inconsistencies, but it's exactly what I've been looking for at a great price. I'm very excited to have this set.

  I really wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Everything came in a timely manor. I started watching these with my son. The first two movies played just fine, nothing fancy, can’t fast forward or rewind, no big deal. When I put in what was supposed to be Prisoner of Azkaban, it was a completely different movie, and the quality was so horrible that I couldn’t even identify the movie, but it definitely was NOT any of the Harry Potter movies. I put in Goblet of Fire after and it didn’t even play anything at all. Just a blank screen, same with Order of the Phoenix. I gave up after that. Will definitely be returning and would heavily advise that Amazon take this item down. I wasn’t expecting a lot for $40.00 for 8 movies, but I expected them to at least be watchable. Only two of the 8 movies worked.I guess you get what you pay for.

  The discs are all good quality and play well, although the main disc menu is not the same across all 8 films, which is a little disorienting. Some of the discs have a movie image with the expected play/scenes/features options, others go straight to a wordy, complicated menu with weird special features and extra scenes.Pro: you have the full collection! It plays well, and fits in a compact space on your shelf!Pro: the movies have some special features!Con: inconsistent disc menusCon: special features are a little thin and also not standard from disc to disc.Overall happy with purchase, because my individually-purchased versions of films 1-8 were getting old and buggy. Would recommend, unless you're looking for the uber-collector's edition, 'cause this isn't it.

  Let's start off by specifying which exact item I bought, there are a lot of Harry Potter movie options available.  The one I bought was the multi-format version and is somewhere over the 100 price point.  It is much more expensive than the bare DVD/Bluray options alone, but it is a true collector's edition.  It has 31 (!) discs and they are all packaged in a beautiful hardcover ""book"".  The discs cover the DVD/Bluray/Special Features and the whole book is gorgeous with art.  If you are a serious Harry Potter fan, you should definitely get this edition.  I feel like I don't need to bother reviewing the movies themselves at this point, but in case you aren't familiar with them, they are great movies and pretty much an integral part of culture by now.

  I am very pleased with this set.  I did not need bells and whistles, like all sorts of behind the scenes or extra scenes or whatever.  I wanted the full set of movies because my collection was a mix of VHS and DVD and not complete.  This set is packed in a very sturdy case with all movies on separate DVDs.  The DVDs are substantial.  I've watched the first DVD and it has excellent video and audio.  I'm happy.  The price is pretty amazing as well.

  Thought long and hard if this would be worth the price, but when I found a good deal I decided to go for it. I have an Oppo 4 K player and 7 Klipish surround speakers with a sub woofer. My TV is an LG 4K UHD and I have a Yamaha receiver. Have only played the first movie so far and was nearly blown away.  Everything is fantastic.  The only problem was with the shipping. The mailman was to deliver on Sunday, My husband and I had just returned from shopping so garage door was open. I was walking the dog  and saw the mailman WEDGE the pkg into box. We had to cut the box to remove! It was wedged in so tightly it would have been faster for him to bring to door. fortunately the box holding film wasn't damaged. Husband took to post office on Mon. and left with them. I notice it is marked that this pkg. was handed off at delivery!!!! I don't think so. I was lucky that the movies and box it was in was intact.

  My wife purchased this for me for Christmas with the sole intent to have the 4k version and the digital version of the films.  I opened it Christmas morning and my wife told me I needed to enter the codes for the digital copy quickly as they were set to expire on the 12/31/2018.  I went ahead and Christmas morning attempted to enter the codes and they didn't work.  i tried multiple times using a variety of devices and they codes wouldn't work. I know it wasn't the VUDU app as I redeemed multiple movies that day.  I would enter a code and it would say I had to update my account but I had an active VUDU account and if I entered the code again it wouldn't say, ""code already redeemed"".  There is an issue with the code itself and this should have been advertised as blu-ray and 4k ""the digital codes do not work"".  Waste of money and a big disappointment.

  The 4k version seems fine, but if you really analyze the transfer, I think it looks like a regular HD image enlarged to 4k. Perhaps it's just that the original film is somewhat soft, but no part of this film (looking at Year 1) looks like it takes advantage of the sharpness that 4k provides. It just looks soft and honestly there are some mild compression artifacts. Even the color seemed just a bit washed out compared to many other recent 4k films.I would not be surprized if Warner Brother does another ""proper"" 4k transfer with new HDR color grading. But, all things considered, this is a great film series and probably the best version available today.

  I was a little nervous about buying this because of all the reviews that said they received piecemeal sets rather than a single, uniform collection. I took a chance anyway, and I'm glad I did. The set I received was brand new, and all of the discs were consistent. All discs had photo images, none were the plain silver discs that some reviewers received. Also, all discs were brand new with no scratches or wear on them. The outer box was shrink wrapped, and the inner case containing all the discs had another layer of shrink wrap. Set doesn't include special features, but I'm not much of a special features person anyway. This set was exactly what I wanted and I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

  4K REVIEW : Ordered twice. Both times the seal was broken. Thought it was counterfeit/used initially. The box shows a digital code (EXP 12/31/18) which was not present in either box set, so I assume they broke the seal to remove it? Obviously wasn’t disclosed in description which is slightly disappointing.I have not watch them yet, once we do I may adjust star rating based if the quality is good. Audio should be listed as DTS Master Audio HD but the box only shows Dts:X.Update 6/14/19*** We have seen 5 of the movies and I will admit the quality of 4k is amazing. The spells looks brighter, the dark scenes more captivating and the sound is crystal clear. Quidditch matches sounded like they were doing the chase work in our living room. Added a 4th star , but still feel like the description should state that they are selling 4k copies with expired codes therefore removed.

  I almost always read reviews before making a purchase, but I didn't this time because this was exactly what I knew I wanted: a complete set of all eight Harry Potter movies with minimal packaging. I never imagined that I'd receive a box full of obviously pirated discs, most of which were unwatchable. The sound quality is terrible - we had to turn the TV up way higher than we normally do. The picture is low-resolution, and darker and dimmer than than it should be. Five of the eight discs are covered in scratches and unplayable. I can't believe, with almost 2,200 negative reviews, that Amazon lets this ""AGAWAM ENTERPRISES, LLC"" continue selling discs that are obviously illegal copies burned on someone's computer.

  I purchased this disk set during Prime Day and haven't gotten around to watching it until last week.  When I got to disk 4 I noticed it was a little thicker than normal and my bluray player gave me an error.  Upon further inspection I realized there was a manufacturing quality defect, and the disk had 2 disks fused together.  As you can see in the picture, the disk had a second clear disk attached to it and the movie was burned to the clear disk and not the real disk.Unfortunately, because I didn't watch it within the return window, I couldn't get a replacement disk.  However, Amazon customer service still gave me a partial refund for the cost of the disk in the set to off set the replacement cost.

  I think it’s a pirated DVD set! When I read the reviews I was nervous about buying this, now I regret it!! After looking at the dvd’s they don’t look like the dvds that come with the set they sell in stores, some of the dvds are marked with Disc 1 yet there is no other disc that goes with that movie. Disc 3 played until it got to about an hr in and then froze up, disc 4 starts with the movie title and says “disc one” on the screen but..no disc 2, nor should there be. The picture isn’t good quality on any of the dvd’s, and when the 5 or 6th disc wouldn’t play, I took them out and finger prints were on the side that the dvd reads. Very very disappointed with this

  The rating is for the quality of the video, not the movies themselves. It's quite disingenuous to not specifically say that the 4K box set is actually 2k up-scaled, however the quality is noticeably better than 1080p.  If you are a hardcore fan like myself, I say the purchase is worth it; if you are on a budget, I would not recommend spending more for the UHD discs over the standard blu-ray set unless it is on sale.

  I am a major fan of the Harry Potter Movies (I grew up with them), they were on every holiday on one of our local channels, extremely cheap TV but we still got to watch all of them (or all there were at the time, not all of them were out).The movies themselves are great, they were well done, and you can see the progression of the actors, characters, and story with each one. And I would rate the collection itself, in regards to the movies, as masterful. I enjoyed every single one, and do not regret this purchase in the slightest.However, there is a caveat here, Movie 6 (Halfblood Prince) has an ad in it (rather than simply starting like the first 5 did), it has an ad for a Wizard of Oz collectors edition or something. Very random, totally not needed, would rather it NOT have that. Not sure if it is specific to this collection, the DVD itself (that they were all made this way; Bluray technically), or what was going on, but a random ad is annoying. Not a dealbreaker, but I am subtracting a point for the principle of it.I've yet to watch the final two, will update if they have this or something equally sketchy too.

  I was expecting quality to be less than stellar after reading the reviews for this set, but was willing to give up some quality for the good price. As expected, the quality is not great, and the movies tend to blip out for a second from time to time. But that’s not the biggest issue.They sent the wrong movies.The third dvd in the set is labeled Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban, but it is The Polar Express. What a disappointment to find in the middle of a Harry Potter movie binge. And the seventh is labeled Harry Potter and the deathly hallows part 1, but only plays the intro to a game on a loop. I can overlook the expected quality issues, but sending the wrong dvds is a big problem.

  So to start off, all 8 discs had Harry Potter and the various titles written on them. I soon discovered I had 2 Harry Potter’s and the Goblet of Fires. So no Sorcerer’s Stone. The Goblet of Fire DVD’s had opening DVD menus that resembled poorly animated video games. You could tell it looked like someone had tried, and miserably failed at making it look like the ‘real deal’. It appears they were poorly pirated with chunks of the movie missing. The Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban DVD was actually the Polar Express movie. While I enjoy the Polar Express during the Christmas holiday, I was not particularly enthused this time around. I unfortunately can’t return this because I purchased this as a Black Friday deal of last year and not having a DVD player, did not come to the realization this was the “quality” product I received until last night. Would have given two stars if I had gotten a Monsters Inc. DVD instead of Polar Express.

  So, Harry Potter is awesome. Repackaged products sold as something new, are not. Most of these blu-rays do not have a startup title menu, meaning the movie begins as soon as you insert the disc. What's odd is that Half Blood Prince does indeed have a menu. And I didn't realize why until I noticed the disc itself says ""Disc 1"". Usually you only see that in a 2-disc set. I also noticed the Deathly Hallows (parts 1 and 2) discs both say ""The Movie"" as if they too were part of an individual box set. Not the end of the world, but these discs do not contain the extra features the other discs do. A little uniformity would have been nice. It's quite clear to me that this box set is just an ensemble of older products repackaged and sold as something new.

  Fantastic price ($39.99) for the whole 8-movie DVD set. If you have read the books, don't expect these to perfectly follow, and expect to find that so much of the detail had to be left out. Each book could make a whole mini-series if they left everything in. The magic is well done, not too cheesy. The characters are mostly what you pictured from reading the books. I enjoyed watching them, just for fun, after I read the whole series. If you're wondering if you should read the books first or watch the movies first, read the books. You'll understand a lot more of the story. If you've never read the books, some of the plots might seem a little flat, and you might not totally understand the motivations of all of the characters. But they're still great to watch and it's wonderful that the same actors were able to do the whole series. (Except for a few of the less-important ones, and Dumbledore is portrayed by 2 excellent actors who are very similar in appearance and manner) You get to watch the whole cast grow from kids to young adults, and that's pretty rare in a series like this.

  My review is solely based on the condition of the packaging. When we received our 8 pieces set the container was broken. There must be some type of hex or curse on it as well because none of my repairing spells seem to be working.If you are looking to buy the set I give the movies and storyline 5 plus stars the element of imagination is so magical. I have enjoyed sharing my love for the wizarding world with my family.

  This set I bought had 8 disks, had the castle cover art and looks like a typical movie set upon first glance. The materials used to combine this set is cheap feeling and very flimsy. When arrived and opened for inspection, I had movies loose inside and some of the tabs used to hold the BluRay disks were already broken.Looking at the disks, I see something very odd about this set. It looks like this set was put together by cannibalizing individual movies (that were part of multi-disk set themselves) There is no consistency between the disk arts (which other sets take some additional effort to actually make it look like a ""set""). Going back to my cannibal comment, I would like to comment further on this by saying that Half-blood Prince has HUGE Disk 1 text alongside the obnoxious Blu-ray Disk blue ball graphic taking about 1/6 of the disk. Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 both have ""The Movie"" subtext on it further solidifying that these disks were indeed part of other sets that were plucked out and put into this substandard set.If you want to have a set of the movies, this product delivers.If you want to have a set of the movies that looks like a CHEAP SET, this product delivers.

There are no scratches on the cds or anything. Our blu ray player is playing all our other cds just fine but these just say no cd recognized. And it is not just one of them. We had trouble and had to put them in several times to get them to work in the first place, then they just stopped. Wish I could get an exchange, but it's out of my time frame.

  The first 4 films do not have main menus. Special features are available for these first 4 films but only after the movie is finished playing. You can skip scenes to get to the end though. Very weird. I'm not sure I can explain why they're like that. My best guess is that these were ripped from Region 2 originals and the main menu no longer exists. Order of the Phoenix is the most legitimate of all the discs as it has a proper menu and seems that it really was supposed to be just one disc. I say ""supposed to be just one disc"" because Half Blood Prince says ""disc 1"" right on it (with disc 2 being left behind in whatever set this disc 1 was harvested from). Deathly Hallows Part 1&2 both say ""The Movie"" on them. That implies that wherever these two discs came from either had other discs that said ""bonus features"" or even ""the soundtrack"" on them. This set is without a doubt a Frankenstein. What it all means and where it came from is anyone's guess. I am happy to be able to have all the movies on Blu-ray, but you've got to know what you're getting into with this set.

  The 4K discs,that came with this collection, runs at 30 Mega Bits per second to 100 Mega Bits per second. It is like watching these movies with a new prescription for your glasses. These 4K images are much clearer than the Blu-Ray versions of these wonderful films. The sound quality (Dolby Atmos) is much improved an plays at 8.1 through my media set-up. I recommend this product.

  For the price of the entire collection saves me about more than $100 if I were to see the entire 8 movies in the theatre in today's prices.  I only saw the 1st movie in the theatres when it came out.  The rest, I have not seen.  After my trip to Universal Orlando to the Harry Potter world there, I had to buy this collection to refresh the storylines.  So on my next return visit to Universal Orlando, I should be able to compare the theme park to the movies.  (maybe I should read the books as well eh!)In regards to the DVD format, it's only in ""theatrical"" view.  I have a full room surround sound style speakers.  Depending on our settings, I only have my sounds through the front and woofer's only.  Not the rear speakers for background noise effects.

  Just bought 2 sets, 1 for us, 1 for a gift. Both sets arrived yesterday. We were so excited that we watched 1st movie immediately - GREAT! Scenes we've NEVER seen before too! Super Happy!Then we watched the 2nd movie - 4 times the DISC SKIPPED! We took it out and low & behold there are some scratches on our literally BRAND NEW disc!I know we can likely get our set replaced; however, I'm worried now about giving the other set as a gift. They won't be opening it until Christmas. What if there's also an issue with their set? What then?

  If you're a Harry Potter fan and have a good 4K TV, this is for you. The environment of Hogwarts alone, with its dimly lit corridors and at times heavy motion and effects during many of the movies' scenes, could easily become a washed-out mess of poor definition. Not here. Everything's rendered (thanks in part to the HDR) in rich color (even into subtle shades of velvety black/charcoal), and the definition is, well, high. Duh. ;-) Far outperforms earlier Blu-Ray transfers I've seen and owned.

  This is 8 DVDs in a case. That's about the only thing that qualifies them as a ""set"".In my ""set"" I have 3 different styles of design, as the discs clearly came from 3 different editions.This is especially noticeable since one of the discs is marked ""Disc 1 movie"", sonic clearly started life as part of a two disc set.Also worth noting, the aspect ratio is different depending on which of the 3 styles of discs its playing.Sos the sound balance. On some(unfortunately most) of the discs I have to get the volume near 80 to even begin to hear anything. But on other discs, 40 is too loud.And of course because we have 3 different styles of disc, forget about any kind of consistency with special features. Some discs have them. Some dont. Some have parts of what was intended to be a feature across all movies, some dont ect ect ect.I give 2 stars because to be fair, this is a box with all 8 movies in it, and they do play the films. And it costs less than buying the movies separately. So if that's all your interested in, buy. If you want anything else, or a modicum of consistency, look elsewhere m

  The 4K rendition does make a noticeable difference in image quality with these Harry Potter films. The image quality is such that one feels like they are in a movie theater with no reduction in picture or sound quality (at least with a 5.1 speaker setup and a powered subwoofer) in a home theater environment.Movie theaters with people chit chatting or checking text messages on their phones and the smell of popcorn and people opening up candy wrappers is not something I will ever miss. Now with the 4K movies I get all the positive aspects of watching a moovie in a theater without the negative ones and with the panedemic that will be a factor for years, these 4K Harry Potter movies are a good investment.

  Finally! A collector's edition for adults. If you are over 18 years old and want a box set of the Harry Potter movie saga... this is the one to get. The discs themselves are the standard blu-rays you get from previous releases. The difference is the box set itself. I collect blu-rays so presentation is important. On this one the disc is thick and strong and has great artwork. The discs themselves are held in a photo album type of booklet that is itself  made of nice quality.The only downside is that I am not a big fan of the cardboard style holders that you insert the discs in. They tend to scratch the disc if you are not careful. Still, I think the pluses outweigh the minus here and it still rates as the best of the Harry Potter Box Sets.

The discs I received were in a nice box set and shrink wrapped in plastic, but the discs themselves were covered in fingerprints when I opened the set, and at least one was all scratched up, like it was used and then repackaged to look new!

  Oh yes, this review IS about Harry Potter and not about how crummy the delivery service was.  These films failed to win me, unlike The Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones.  Here we have a problem of pacing, cinematography (a lot of happenings in the dark so one can't see what is what) and not a very compelling main character.  The core of the problem lies in the stories themselves, not very life affirming, blured demarcation of good and evil, I mean, we do know from the begining that Snape/Severus is evil without anyone telling us, I guess they should not have Allan Rickman play him if it was to be a secret and finally, maybe this should have been made for adults, I wouldn't want my children to dwell in any of these gonigs-ons.

  Questioning the legitimacy of these discs, I’m inclined to believe this is a pirated version of the films. I bought these last year, finally sat down to watch them and a couple of things are odd. The first five movies started playing as soon as they were inserted, no trailers or main menu, and my Blu-ray player marks them as “Unnamed Disc.” The last three movies had all of the things missing from the others. The cover of the 6th disc also says “Disc One: Movie” which implies it was originally part of a Half Blood Prince box set and was moved into this case of movies.With all of that said, the movies are high quality if they are pirated. There were two very brief moments where the sound cut out and you miss half a word of dialogue but that didn’t particularly bother me.

  While there are more scenes  than in regular production, I have seen better & more on TV - such as where Harry goes & what he sees between the Ball & the scene on the stairs as they are leaving with Hermione asking ""where have you been?"" to Harry while being seriously pissed at Ron for being a jealous jerk.  Point being for the price I was bummed several discs didn't work at all even in my nice new blue ray, and the deleted scenes as I said, and sound fluctuation on most all of them!!  Horrible loud then quiet. There's several discs we haven't gotten to but for the money. I could have been just as happy with the small set of the uncut movies.  It was a gift for my hubby though so of course I went big. I'd cut a star in half if that was an option for the issues.

  This was on sale for the holidays for like $80 but apparently I was too late and was charged $139. I must admit that I did not read the description well enough to realize that this is just the movies and nothing else. No special features, no digital codes. Just 2 boxes, one with the blurays and one with the ultra 4K.While it is really nice to have the whole set of movies in one box, it feels like they put together the bare minimum for a maximum price.  In this era it should be standard to include the digital codes and the special features, especially if you're going to charge THAT much money (which only real fans would pay)

  I'm still not seeing the flaws some people have complained about here.  The outer box is basic, but not really cheap or flimsy.  The individual disc cases and labels are perfectly adequate.  I suppose they could be even more fancy and elaborate...but do I really care?  No.I have no complaints about the quality of the discs or the playback.  With the first five discs the movie does start right up when you insert the disc, rather than going first to a menu screen.  Half-Blood Prince and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 have proper menus that come up first, and separate special features discs with more and better extras.  But there *are* bonus features on the first five discs--trailers, deleted scenes, short interviews with cast and crew, the usual stuff.  You can access them by pressing the ""disc menu"" button on your remote, or you can sit through all the multi-lingual anti-piracy warnings after the end credits--the menu will pop up.  I imagine there would be more goodies on the deluxe edition discs, but I didn't pay the cost of the deluxe edition, did I?  If you're looking at this set I'm betting a lot of you don't want to, either.I think this *is* the region-free version that other reviewers are recommending that you order from Amazon.co.uk.  The URL printed on the disc cases is warnerbros.co.uk.  The age rating symbols on the box are the ones awarded by the British Board of Film Classification and the Irish Film Classification Office.  After each movie ends, you see dozens of anti-piracy warnings, in every language under the sun--I've never seen that on a US version DVD.  Also, everywhere in the first film--on the packaging, on the disc, in the titles, in the dialog--they refer to the ""philosopher's stone"" rather than the ""sorcerer's stone.""  (The original UK book title was ""Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone"" but the US publisher thought that would put off American readers, so they dumbed it down to ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.""  They did the same with the movie so as not confuse fans of the book.  But they only changed it in the US--everywhere else it was always ""Philosopher's Stone.""  Personally, I find having the movie with the original title a plus!)  The one thing I cannot find anywhere on the discs or packaging is the region code--but clearly, these are not the standard US editions.

  I read other reviews (after already purchasing) regarding issues with boot leg copies of movies, character's speech not lining up with their mouth, etc. I saw that I only had 30 days to return the movies and since there are so many discs, I went ahead and watched them right away to check for potential problems. The first two movies I watched were perfect, but then I came across a boot leg copy of The Polar Express movie instead of the Prisoner of Azkaban. I am still going through the rest to check for other issues. I am so disappointed and annoyed.

  The sound and picture quality is fantastic. If you like Harry Potter you owe to yourself to watch these movies in 4K HDR.Even if 3 to 8 are 2K masters upscaled to 4K, HDR does wonders. Black crush is gone, and CGI looks fantastic.

  I got this set -- the one with all 8 in the box with the castle on front -- a couple years ago. I thought something was off about the first HP film (Sorcerer's Stone), and over the weekend I figured out what it was. I was at a friend's home and we watched the Sorcerer's Stone, which was the original version we all saw in cinemas. What is in THIS set, however, isn't that version. Case in point:  in the set I received, in HP1 the part of Potions class where Snape comes down to Harry's desk (and tells Hermoine to put her hand down, silly girl), and he sits in front of Harry and answers all those questions he (Snape) just asked Harry, and then tells them points will be taken from Gryffindor for their classmate's cheek....that part of this scene is not in the Sorcerer's Stone version that comes in this set. It's almost as if these are the abridged/edited versions that you may see on TV.  I'm going to now order a different version, and it better be what I'm expecting!!

  This review is not a review for the movies on the discs but for this particular distribution of the content.With 16 discs the failure rate is bound to be a bit high, but with the 4k discs we had 2 out of the 8 that won't load.  Visual inspection shows no obvious defects on the media.  These issues could have been easily caught by QA.We did not test the Blu-ray discs.Lastly the plastic box that the discs came was damaged during shipping, this was not major but when you are spending this amount of money on a product it would be nice if they packaged them in boxes that were not so brittle.

  I’m really upset with the quality of these disks. I looked them over when they first arrived, and they seemed fine. But as we have been watching them; each disk has issues while playing. The pixels start going out, then it starts skipping, and then it won’t play an entire chunk (multiple scenes)! I know it’s not my player, because all other disks are working fine. And of course, I’m just passed the time for returns. 🙄

  This review is for the 8 disk boxed blu-ray collection with Hogwarts and first-years in boats on the cover. Disappointment after disappointment, not with the movies, but with the versions and the packaging. The movies are the slightly shorter theatrical versions, not the extended versions that are available for purchase and that I was used to seeing on commercial TV. The disk starts up playing the movie, not with the menu to choose playing the movie or viewing the extras, and the movie plays with subtitles on (as well as some of the extras, annoying). The case is of poor quality, the disks pop loose and rattle around too easily. The movies are great, if all you want to see is what was shown in theaters. I shouldn't have gone for the least expensive blu-ray option. The return process is disappointing also, no exchange option. Why amazon?

  Amazon does not separate the reviews for each of the different sets unfortunately, so for my review I hope to clarify what the Blu-ray set features.Movies 1-5 have special features, such as deleted scenes, cast interviews, etc. When I play the movies on my tv, the movie automaticaly starts playing and does not bring you to a menu of any sort, so in order to access these special features you have to manually go to it on your remote. In my case, I just click the ‘Pop-up menu’ on my remote and then it brings me to a menu of all the special features.Movies 6-8 do not have those special features, but instead only have the ‘Maximum movie mode’ option which I have not used yet.I just have two minor complaints about this set. Movie 5 came with some scratches on it and freezes/skips sometimes. I cleaned the disc with a microfiber cloth after the first time I watched it, and the second time I watched the film, it skipped once at a totally different time in the movie. This wasn’t that big of a deal to me, because Movie 5 is my least favorite out of the series and it played perfectly fine other than that one time.Also, the disc for Movie 6 appeared to be from a different set than the rest. The disc read ‘Disc 1’ as if it was taken from a multi-disc set. I found this to be odd but not a big deal.Overall, this is a great set for any Harry Potter fans who just want all the movies and aren’t too concerned about having all the special features. The price is unbeatable and the case has all 8 movies in it, so it is extremely compact and easy to travel with.

  The movies, of course, are exceptional.  I love them all and have watched them multiple times. The special features are great (some information does repeat in multiple discs, but that doesn't bother me).  The big bound album for the DVDs is cool, it's a real collector's item. Looks great on the shelf.My only issue is the UltraViolet digital download.  What a disaster.  The first code I got was expired, so amazon had me return the entire thing, sent me a new one.  It had an acceptable code, and when I finally was able to redeem it .... it redeemed Deathly Hallows Part 1 and nothing else.  The website provided with the UV code no longer exists so it prompts you to visit a different website. I went through all that nonsense, and it still isn't right.  I called FANDANGO a month ago with the issue and still have no had it resolved.  I called again today and she escalated my request so we will see what happens with that.

  It has EVERYTHING you could possibly want in a Harry Potter collection. It does include BOTH the extended and theatrical versions of the first two movies, HOWEVER only the first two movies have an ""actual"" extended version, movies 3-8 are the only versions.

  Hadn't been able to watch any of these movies until about 8-9 months after purchase. Halfway through the 3rd disc movie (Prisoner of Azkaban), the entire movie stops and returns to the""Special Features"" Section of the main menu (not even the main menu itself). The rest of the movie cannot be played nor accessed through fast forwarding nor scene selections after a specific scene (Scene 20: Seeing the Impossible). Wish I had watched all the videos upon first receiving this Set, can't even get my money back to purchase a proper DVD Set. Also realized after reading reviews after realizing the movie issue, all my DVDs look like burner versions similar to other past customers. Extremely disappointed and will be advising fellow family and friends to not purchase from this same company/person.

  What is there to say about this? Harry Potter is a staple in our household, so when I saw these DVDs at the Black Friday price of almost 50% off, I had to pick them up for my boyfriends daughter so she can have a set of her very own at her house (I've had my own for years now). These are packaged nicely and include all 8 movies, and although there are no extras or special features included, they make a brilliant gift! If you're a Harry Potter fan, and only own 1 or 2 movies, I highly suggest this set. It will be worth the duplicate movies for an all-inclusive bundle!

  7 of the 8 discs played properly.  The 8th -- Year 5, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix -- locked up at Ch. 17 on a 2 week old player that had no issues with any of the other DVDs in the set or with any of our other DVDs.  I saw no scratches or thumb prints on the disc to account for the problem.  When I tried the disc on both my computer and another DVD player, it locked up at the same place.  Amazon sent a replacement set and it behaved identically, locking up at Ch. 17 of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.The balance of Disc 5 was fine and, but for what appears to be a manufacturing defect, I would have rated this set 5 stars.  If you can put up with the defect, manually jump your player from Ch. 16 to 18, or are willing to replace the defective disc with a stand alone Order of the Phoenix, this set is a very good deal.  For several reasons, I could not accept a defective disc and so returned both sets to Amazon.  Amazon was a pleasure to deal with:  the return was handled easily and quickly.

  I have watched the first film about 17 times... but mainly because I literally cannot stay awake until the end. The film is good so far, as I’ve only made it about 49 minutes into the film before passing out into a very deep slumber. I don’t know what it is about these types of fantasy films but they work like lullaby for me every single time. This and lord of the rings along with the hobbit movies and all that stuff is also like a lullaby. If I ever get up in the night and I’m wide awake and can’t sleep, I just slap in this baby and I’m asleep within 20 minutes. Works like a charm.

  Reviewing the Blu-Ray formatPretty solid box set for a little under $50 but if you’re looking for something definitive, this probably isn’t what you want. The disc formatting is really inconsistent and all of the movies until #6 don’t even have a main menu and on top of that the in-movie pop up menus are different in each movie. The last 3 movies all have main menus, as well as previews for some reason. Which is fine, but the previous 5 hadn’t done that, so I found it odd. The discs are of a visibly different format. I would have also liked a digital code.If you just want to add these movies to your collection to watch occasionally (like me) this is a pretty good set but if you are a big Harry Potter fan looking for the biggest, baddest definitive box set, look elsewhere.

  Thought I'd save some money and buy them used, just slightly, and boy was that dumb. All of the disks are very scratched indicating that the were VERY used. You can't go 30 minutes in each movie without coming to a part that keeps skipping or the picture gets super pixelated.  Very very frustrating and you basically can't watch the movie because it gets so bad that you miss a scene or two in a row. I should've just purchased the new ones cause now I'm going to have to buy a new set so I can actually see the movie. Don't be cheap; buy the new discs.

I should've just purchased the new ones cause now I'm going to have to buy a new set so I can actually see the movie. Don't be cheap; buy the new discs.

  I thought I got a great deal on these but I guess I was wrong. I just unwrapped them from the shrink wrap today and the discs will not play on two different DVD drives (two different PCs). Both of the DVD drives are for the US. The DVDs SAY they are for US and Canada only. But they will seemingly only play on a European DVD player???In addition, several discs are scratched right out of the box. I’ve included a picture of the second disc with the scratches in the upper right side of the disc.Also the 7th disc slot will not lock into place in the case.Looking more closely at the cover I think it may be bootleg? I’m not sure. It seems like it might have questionable quality.I will be requesting a full refund for this ASAP.Edit: I went back digging through the reviews for this item and found several people who had purchased the DVD set like me and received burned/bootleg DVDs. I also realized that the preview of this item shows box art and art on the discs themselves that is completely different from what I received. Completely unacceptable. I will be reporting this to Amazon.

  I bought 4 sets (all defective) from Happybabies, who insulted me (see their ratings.) I bought another set from another seller - the same discs would not load. To humor Happybabies, I had a friend (redundantly and irrelevantly) try to load them on his different model player - they would not load. I then contacted Warner Brothers directly and after discussion with their representative I was told they do have issues with discs not loading from a certain production batch. Warner Brothers will be sending me replacement discs so that I do not have to return the whole collection again. Regardless of Happybabies claimed experiences, there is a problem with these specific discs in the collection. Happybabies rudeness and implied insult of me during this exchange was unjustified.

  The movie looks good and the dtsx soundtrack is great.  However, there are problems playing the movies that continually arise on the xbox one x.  Most often, the movies are not recognized by the player and I need to start to play some other bluray movie on it and then restart the harry potter movie to get it to play. I've only gotten through the first movie and started the second movie.  Problems with both movies starting them, but I did get them started.  Since I bought the collection on prime day for $80, I'm not quite as concerned as if I'd paid over $100 for it.  I've seen other reviewers post this issue using other 4k players so it is likely a problem with the movies themselves. If you purchase the collection, be forewarned of this issue.  You may need to tinker with each movie to play it.

  Do not buy this version if you’re anticipating seeing the full length movies.  I bought this because I thought it was going to be the full length movies. We’ve been watching these and have now reached disk 4. Unfortunately #4 does not play the full version of the movie. there is no main menu for any option! Very disappointing.

   Weirdly enough, the third DVD which is supposed to be the Prisoner of Azkaban (and is labeled as so) is actually the movie The Polar Express lol. Luckily I love that movie too but now I’m missing that one out of the series... I made sure to look through all of them after I found that out and they all seem to be legit versions with the options to play the movie,scene selection, features, and different languages.

  If you buy this, make sure you check your discs to make sure you got what you paid for. I did not get a 4k UHD copy of Deathly Hollows Part 2. They packaged 2 copies of the regular blu-ray version instead. I will update this review when I get my replacement copy of the collection. Hopefully they get it right this time.I did watch the UHD version of Sorcer's Stone, and it looked great. Really wish they had packaged this correctly in the first place.UPDATE: I received a replacement copy after about 2 weeks, and this one had all the 4k UHD and standard Blu-ray versions, thankfully. I'm leaving this at 1 star because it's ridiculous that they goofed this up in the first place. The UHD and Blu-Ray discs look very similar to each other, so I'm pretty lucky I noticed before it was too late to return.

I had read reviews on this product saying that there were various problems with the discs but I decided to take the chance and order anyway. The last 3 would not play at all. We have multiple DVD players in our home and the discs just did not work at all. Also there were no pictures on the front of the DVDs. It was just the title and on some of them the words were askew,which that does not seem right.. Anyway,I am very upset and sending the movies back today.

  I wasn’t initially a Harry Potter fan until very recently, but this set is a terrific roadmap to a fantastical world of magic. The only issue I have is the case doesn’t hold the discs very well, and keeping them in is like playing with a house of cards. But as I sit down to watch the final chapter in the Harry Potter series, I find it isn’t a problem worthy of a 4 star review since J.K. Rowling did such an amazing job in creating the magical, and expansive world of Hogwarts. This is the type of of world I work to create in my own books.

There is a distinct lack of legal info on the discs and most of the case, the labels are inconsistent and crooked, I could go on forever.

  I'm giving this 5 stars for a few reasons. The case was in tact when i received it. No broken pieces of plastic anywhere (which hasn't been the case with previous film franchise's i've bought here). The discs are not scratched at all. You'd think that would be obvious with brand new products, but haha, experience has taught me otherwise. One odd thing though, it almost seems like all the discs were ""taken"" from the individual movies and tossed into this collection. The first 5 discs just start the movie when i select the disc on my player. The final 3 actually have menus to them. So, like, the discs weren't designed/programmed to be part of an official collection. I mean, they all play fine and are great, i'm happy with this purchase, so not complains. As i said, just odd.

  Thankfully, the first 4 movies were fine. However, we go to watch the 5th, and it is messing up. We never touched the 5th movie until tonight when we put it in the DVD player. So when the movie started glitching, we pulled it out and looked at the disc, and there were blemishes we were unable to wipe off. So the movie is unwatchable. Kinda sucks when you buy a whole box set and the middle movie won't even work to bridge the gap between the beginning and end of the most amazing series ever! Also, since I am now an adult, and do not have the time to binge-watch movies like I used to, I did not discover this terrible flaw in my product in time for the refund/return policy date. Guess I need to go check my Vikings box set too now, since I bought them around the same time and I'm only on season 1 :(

  First off, I want to start off by saying these movies are incredible, but the product itself is what I am dissatisfied with. I appreciate the amount of extras included with the collection. However I bought this set brand new and several of discs already had scratches on them. I don't think this is a fault to the seller so much as to the actual packaging itself.Rather than going with the preferable and likely cheaper option of putting them in a plastic blu ray case like the other variation of the collection, they decided to put them in these terrible paper slits. Now with my other blu rays that are in similar slits, like the Alien Anthology or the Steven Spielberg collection, they're pretty easy to get out. But with this collection when you pull the discs out you, every time you try to get them out, the bottom of the disc cant help, but be damaged by the top part of the slit keeping them in. With those other collections, the discs came out the side without the use of a guard and had an outer case for keeping them in.It's easy to see the purpose of the tops of the slits, they're there to keep the discs from falling out. Great idea, but terrible execution. And because there's not much room to pull the disc out, you could potentially scratch and smear the bottom part of the disc just getting them out. If you do think about buying this particular collection, I'd recommend buying a couple Viva elite blu ray cases to put the actual discs in, that way they don't get damaged every time you want to watch the films. Even though it will damage the book, I would just cut the tops of those blu ray slits, make it easier to gently slide the disc out and place it in the safer blu ray cases. Plus the book is just too flimsy and a complete pain in the ass for getting out to watch movies. There isn't any interesting artwork on the inside to even justify such ridiculous packaging. I'm giving this package a one star review simply because the packaging only hurts the movies you intend to watch and there's no justification for it's large size.Why not have an option for a collection with ultimate edition blu rays and bonus disc and remove the DVDs? You could have a much smaller book that way and could do the disc slits similar to the collections I mentioned earlier (maybe not the best either, but a HUGE improvement over this). I know there's another collection in a standard blu ray casing, but it doesn't come with all the extras so that's why I'm complaining. I bought this one for the bonus material and extended cuts of the first two films.

",6,6-Mar-16,,n,"

  First off, I want to start off by saying these movies are incredible, but the product itself is what I am dissatisfied with. I appreciate the amount of extras included with the collection. However I bought this set brand new and several of discs already had scratches on them. I don't think this is a fault to the seller so much as to the actual packaging itself.Rather than going with the preferable and likely cheaper option of putting them in a plastic blu ray case like the other variation of the collection, they decided to put them in these terrible paper slits. Now with my other blu rays that are in similar slits, like the Alien Anthology or the Steven Spielberg collection, they're pretty easy to get out. But with this collection when you pull the discs out you, every time you try to get them out, the bottom of the disc cant help, but be damaged by the top part of the slit keeping them in. With those other collections, the discs came out the side without the use of a guard and had an outer case for keeping them in.It's easy to see the purpose of the tops of the slits, they're there to keep the discs from falling out. Great idea, but terrible execution. And because there's not much room to pull the disc out, you could potentially scratch and smear the bottom part of the disc just getting them out. If you do think about buying this particular collection, I'd recommend buying a couple Viva elite blu ray cases to put the actual discs in, that way they don't get damaged every time you want to watch the films. Even though it will damage the book, I would just cut the tops of those blu ray slits, make it easier to gently slide the disc out and place it in the safer blu ray cases. Plus the book is just too flimsy and a complete pain in the ass for getting out to watch movies. There isn't any interesting artwork on the inside to even justify such ridiculous packaging.

  This is the absolute greatest thing for HP fans...excluding a trip to the Wizarding World hahaha my husband gifted this to me a couple Christmases ago and it's been fantastic. The extended versions and the hours of bonus material are awesome if you truly wanna know everything about the films. My only qualm was that my blu-ray disk for the first movie was scratched right out of the case. I didn't return it, though, because the return window had passed by the time I had opened it :(

  I ordered this for a Christmas present, we went in to redeem today and it will not allow us to, saying the code has expired. When I went to the Amazon sight it says that the code has been extended until 2019 but it doesn't work. The whole reason I bought this version was so that we could have the digital for us to use on different devices. I am very unhappy and dissatisfied due to this. The disc all work great but it should not advertise that it has a digital code if it doesn't work.Update: We contact warner brothers and they where able to help us out. If you are having issues email them at uvsupport@warnerbros.com. It would have been helpful for the seller to tell us this issue upfront and a way to redeem it.Besides that issue the disc work great and the family is loving watching the show.

  Although this plays in my PS3 bluray player, the quality is very indicative of a bootleg product. Much detail is washed out, such as skin. And the quality is inconsistent during playback. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" says ""Disc 1"", whereas none of the others have a disc number indicated. This tells me these discs were not really made specifically for this set. The labels are not centered as they are on legit Blurays. I am returning this and purchasing each episode separately, which ended up costing an extra $30. Worth it in my opinion.

  I purchased the Blu-Ray  complete series I’m doubtful that this set is legit... 5 out of the 8 discs don’t even have a menu, and none have a “title” that shows up on our smartTV. One of the discs even said “disc 1” on the front but there was no disc 2. The quality on the first 5 discs is terrible, we purchased blu ray so we could have the high def and amazing picture quality, but these are almost fuzzy and the color is way off! I would return it but it was a Christmas present for my son and he was very upset when I mentioned it. Just awful, buyer beware.

  This set arrived better than what I expected! I bought these DVD’s on Black Friday for around $27 which was an extreme deal compared to $80-$99 at other stores. The case is so organized and all the discs were in perfect condition. I’ve already watched them all before reviewing to make sure they all worked correctly and they all work! There is only one minuscule flaw on the artwork for the Half Blood Prince disc which it randomly says “Disc 1” but it doesn’t affect the movie watching experience what so ever nor does it bother me. I just pay attention to fine detail.

  I cannot say enough good things about this. I am an avid J.K. Rowling fan. The first 2 movies are basically carbon copies of the books. The first especially. The further along you get the less like the books the movies are, but that's to be expected when you have books that are at least 700 pages long. The movies are still really good!!! I got a black friday deal, actually on thursday for thanksgiving. It was like $22-$24, which is still about $25-$30 cheaper than at any other time. I just finished a Harry Potter marathon. The DVDs came packaged well.

  I grew up with Harry Potter. I bought the first book in 5th grade, expecting it to be just a casual read. But from the time the Hogwarts Express left London, I was already hooked. This set provides me an ""alternate reality,"" if you will, of how Harry Potter could look, versus how it looked in my mind while reading. The visuals are fantastic, special effects wonderful, and the scoring...oh the scores! Films just aren't done this way any more. If you ask me, years 1 and 2 were among the last well scored films produced.This set is of wonderful quality. For the price, I was expecting a flimsy cardboard box, but was surprised to find it's very thick. An album slides out the side, which holds the disks. Each turn of a page holds a different year, years 1-7. Even the inside of the album is beautiful, decorated with stills from the films.There are no ""extras,"" like promotional items. This is more of a bare bones set. For the price, I say ""well done!"" For those who just want the films and some extra material, this is for you. Any absolute die hard Potter fans out there who want all the bells and whistles, this might not suit you, spring for a more expensive set.

  The quality of the the box set is terrible to say the least. First of all I ordered this set in stock and prime eligible and it took a week to get to me so I was a little frustrated from the start. Then I open up the package and the outer box is damaged. Chose to look past that because it is minor. Picture quality is merky on the cover of the box. Upon opening it one of the videos stuck out because the title is significantly faded and different than the rest. When I turned through each section, the plastic hinge broke the first time I touched it and to top it off the fingerprint smudges were not even wiped off. Going through the dvds to make sure the movie plays and is quality or returning and never buying from them again. It was not super cheap for what I got.  Very disappointing and misleading.

  The movies are awesome and I was very excited to finally own my own set. I had read all the bad reviews on the ""complete 8-film collection"" set but was hoping it was just a fluke. No, almost everything bad I read about this set came true on mine. To start, the DVD's themselves look like they're in poor condition - as if the movies were badly burned on to the disks. The third movie starts playing with ""Polar Express"" and though I was eventually able to find ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" by hitting the menu button a couple times, by hitting the menu button again it would take me back to ""Polar Express."" All that to say, I'm not actually sure which movie was on the DVD and it was very frustrating having to bounce around between movies like that. And then ""Half Blood Prince"" was of such poor quality it looked like I was trying to stream the movie off of YouTube with bad internet.Unfortunately, I got around to testing the DVD's after my return window so am unable to return the DVD's and am very unhappy with this purchase. I would not recommend this set and you would have better luck buying the movies individually.

Picked it up as a gift for the holidays and the package came as described.  this review set up is a little confusing because it seems to bundle up all reviews of the different boxsets.  I got the regular blu-ray not the 4k version and this is just one dvd case with all of the movies back to back.  The quality of the film looks great on an XBOX one. I will come back to update the review after I finish all of the films.  The quality jump from the 1st movie to the second was noticeable.

  Just opening it up out of the package I could feel the hole in the shrink-wrap that was meant to minimally protect the box-case for the film-set. The actual surface to the box-case was litered with scratches, which could be overlooked normally, except for one specifically, which felt deep as if someone dragged the tip of a pen and made the the mathematical Pi symbol. As for the disc-box, just some tiny scratches, otherwise no biggie. Each disc was clean and legit, which was a relief because after seeing the condition of the outer-box I was concerned that I was scammed. Overall, the box could be looked over as the discs, at the moment, seem to be the quality advertised, and it was for a decent price.

  The quality of these DVDs were the worst I have ever seen. The quality was not bad because its DVD as some may say, they were defective DVDs. There was no excuse for how bad the quality was. I was very nervous when I got the set, opened it and saw that none of the discs had images on them like I was expecting and the print was running off the edges on some. I returned this set and got the exact same set from Target. The discs from Target had the images on them which definitely made me realize these DVDs were bad.

  We bought this set for our new son who recently discovered Harry Potter.  We watched the 3rd one first because we had seen the first 2 already.  It stalled and we had to skip over a whole part.  I was going to just shrug if off but then we tried the 2nd one last night and it was even worse.  This was the lease expensive one but not worth it if doesn't work.

  I was wondering why this set was so cheap. We've gone through 3 of the movies which have been heavily edited and just popped in The Prisoner of Azkaban just to find out it's the Polar Express. As soon as I'm finished writing this I'll see if I can return- what a fraud.

  I bought this item as a gift for my daughter for Christmas.  When we finally had a chance to play the first movie in the series last weekend, we were disappointed to find that the Blu-ray was apparently defective.  Within a minute of starting, the video began to pixelate and stop on occasion.  The audio cut out.  Eventually the movie just froze.  I went to Amazon to initiate a return of the item but stopped short because Amazon suggested I upgraded the firmware in my Blu-ray player.  I spent the next eight hours doing just that (don't ask - it involved networking the device, which it hadn't been before).  Anyway, I did upgrade the player and tried again.  Same outcome.  So I asked Amazon for a replacement and shipped the defective set back.The replacement arrived very quickly (kudos to Amazon replacement policies and convenience of return shipment).  I just tried it and, lo and behold, the first movie worked - problem solved!  Well, not really.  I had noticed that the quality of the video wasn't really ""Blu-ray"" - more like SD  (I had noticed it in the first set too, but since it stopped playing entirely then, I attributed it to the disk being bad).  Could it be that the manufacturer of these disks simply converted SD-quality source movies to Blu-ray format?  Or was it that the initial Harry Potter wasn't available in Blu-ray resolution?  To test that theory, I decided to view the last movie in the series.  Since that had just come out in 2012, I figure it must surely be in full Blu-ray quality.  I put the disk in and got the error message ""This disk cannot be played""!  Oh no :-(I know my Samsung Blu-ray player (purchased from Amazon) is not defective as it plays other Blu-ray movies, such as Blade Runner (also purchased from Amazon), just fine - I just checked to make sure.  Therefore, it must be this disk set.  Amazon should really have a word with the manufacturer about their quality control.  I don't seem to be the only one having difficulties with this set.  I gave up on this set.  Returning it today for a refund.Update: I later also had trouble with all the Blu-ray discs I tried from Red Box.  This causes me to rethink that it was the discs, after all.  It looks like my Samsung BD-P1600 is just very picky about what Blu-ray discs it plays (maybe only the old style before BD-Live?)  Updated the star rating.

  We ordered this product and watched the first three movies on the 4K discs.  All of them had randoms skips and even areas where they froze.  We returned the item and were issued a replacement. The same issue happens on the 4k discs in the replacement.  The BluRay discs work fine. We are returning and ordering blu-ray only - not worth the extra $$ for discs that don't work.

  I love the film collection that I have purchased. However disc 7 and 8 will not play the audio in English.  All other disc work without problem. Not sure what to do or who to contact. Amazon had already given me a refund on my digital purchase because it was a theatrical cut. I bought these to have the extended version set. Now it looks like I will have to buy 7 and 8 separately. UGH!!

  Buyer Beware. Along with the other bad reviews, it looks like this christmas gift was a poor choice.The box looks like it was chewed on by a dog before it was sent. Plastic shards from the case all throughout the packaging.I thought it wouldn't be too big of a deal so long as the movies worked... but we only were able to play the first movie. The 2nd movie loads half of the time and the disk cannot be read the other half. Looks like only 90% of the scenes from the movie play when it does read the disk also.Will continue to try the rest of the movies but even at half the price of other options, I would stay far away. After reading other reviews...looks like this is one of the better copies...

  Do not order this item and make the same mistake we did. We have been watching these movies as we finish reading each book. I never checked all of the dvd's when the package arrived - I never considered they would arrive damaged.  Often they are poor quality with bad lighting and would skip, but last night the seventh dvd came out of the box completely scratched and impossible to watch! We had to pay to watch it on Amazon prime video for $3.99. A movie in a box set that we owned that we bought on Amazon.  Not good, and we have no way to return it now. So listen to our mistake - do not purchase this box set from this vendor.

  I got this on Black Friday so for that price it was a good deal. If you want dvd inserts and the digital codes etc don’t by this. This is a no thrills bluRay collection. I got it for my daughter who is just getting into HP so she doesn’t care about all the extra stuff. The disc were clear didn’t appear used no finger prints like other comments. I skipped though all 8 disc all worked none froze or skipped. Not sure if it’s a bootleg or not so I took of a star for that and because some disc say a digital code was supposed to be included & it was missing.

  So we love all these movies but it's really disappointing when you open the package right from the shipped box, sit down to watch with your kids and there are scratches and skips all over them!  I guess I'm not the only one looking at all the reviews of faulty discs.  We're returning immediately and will find another way to get movies without annoying skips...UPDATE: I had it at two stars but have now reduced to one star seeing as this is the 2nd round of movies we have purchased that are all scratched up. We returned the DVD's since they were horrible and we sat down to play the Blue-Ray discs that we purchased to replace the DVD's and they are all glitchy as well.  I'm not certain what the problem is with these discs sold by Amazon.  I've never had any issues with anything from Amazon but this is crazy and a complete waste of my time.  We will be returning these and purchasing from another vender to get discs that are not scratched.

  I got this complete set for $30. I was so excited when I saw it because I have been wanting to get the full film collection for a long time so I jumped on this when I saw this deal. The only reason I took a star off is because there are a couple of pieces of plastic that have already randomly fallen off the case and a couple of spots in the different blu-ray discs where it has skipped some. So happy though that I finally bought this film set!!

This makes me think someone didn't have an extra copy of half blood prince and just took a dvd from the single half blood prince movie.And it also makes me wonder if I'm missing out on extra features by purchasing the entire series.Are there more extra features when you buy each movie by themselves?I mean all I got was 2 minutes of video of the cast saying farewell on the Deathly hollows part 2.I would of have really loved to have seen more that.

  Let me start by saying I purchased the 4K UHD Blu-Ray set of all 8 movies. It came with both the 4K version and blu-ray, one case each. Trying to take out the discs carefully is a challenge, but not horrible. Plays perfect on the Xbox One X, have not tried to play the blu ray on my PS4 pro yet (pro will not play 4K UHD Blu-ray, only straight 4K). The only downfall to this set was during watching Chamber of Secrets and Goblet of Fire it started to skip frames a bit. No noticeable scratches or streaks or marks or dust, so not sure what that was about but it wasn’t a huge deal to me. Hopefully it doesn’t persist. Audio was still playing, just a simple frame pause and then skip a few. Other than that, it’s flawless! Highly recommend if you’re considering it, to make the leap.

Audio improperly matched with video on all Deathly Hallows part 2 discs. First 3 cases had a few broke tabs inside (livable), 4th had that plus a corner cracked and broken off (deal breaker). I would put up with the broken case, I did buy the cheapest blue-ray set on amazon, but the discs have to work at least imho.The product was garbage but Amazon customer service was super helpful, Thank you Amazon employees!!

I would put up with the broken case, I did buy the cheapest blue-ray set on amazon, but the discs have to work at least imho.The product was garbage but Amazon customer service was super helpful, Thank you Amazon employees!! The whole harry potter collection on blue-ray for 44$ seemed to good to be true and it was :/

  Movies are fantastic, however the 6th movie disc (Half Blood Prince) was off a little. It was letter box (thought they did away with this) and on the front it says disc 1, so where's disc two? The visual quality wasnt what it should have been either. Otherwise my only other complaint is that the first 5 discs don't have menus. If not for disc 6 this would easily be 5 stars.

  I was so excited to receive this movie pack. The arrival time was very good. Packaging, no problems there. Pop in disk one, good quality. All set with snacks and drinks.  I’m watching and thinking something isn’t right but I keep watching. Then a scene I really like comes up and it’s not there! That’s when it dawned on me why it seemed off. Scenes have been cut from the movies. Wha???? Why would they do this???? Not a happy camper but better than nothing I guess.

  The plastic case was shattered and some of the discs were obviously burnt copies. We are so disappointed because we were really looking for to watching the entire series but I will not accept them in this condition. I Am going to replace them so hopefully we will get good quality DVD’s the next time around.Update: Again they gave us burnt on copies, with an added bonus... a piece of someone’s glove had ripped off inside the case. Very disappointed in Amazon. This is the first time I’ve had an issue like this.

  In this set, viewers will get all 8 Harry Potter films, in Blu-Ray and full HD quality.  If you enjoy the Harry Potter movies, and don't want tons of special features, this is the set for you.The blu-ray discs do have some basic special features but, do not have the huge amount that the special edition collector sets might have.This set is a great buy.  Every movie for a minimal price.Now, in terms of quality, there are some issues with the set.  It isn't that all of the movies aren't in 1080p, however, the earlier movies were filmed at a time when HD and digital technology was in a newer stage.  So, the earlier movies, while they are scanned or transferred at 1080p, lack the polished, smooth and crisp look that the newer, more modern films have.  It isn't a problem per say, just a reality that a purchaser must be aware of.The audio is great and the newer of the movies are absolutely stunning in HD quality.  The older movies do have some benefit from the transfer but, also some drawbacks as the older CG technologies do not appear to blend or composite quite as well, though only really noticeable to people who look for that kind of thing.The stories are, as they always were, well told interpretations of the book series.  One must always keep in mind that every movie based on a book is just that, an interpretation.  One cannot expect a perfect transition.  Although, in my humble opinion, Dolores Umbridge is just as awful, even with the more limited violence and cruelties compared to the books.If you and your family are fans of the Potter series, this is a great way to get all of them in the best condition and quality possible at a great price.  Don't miss the opportunity.

  I ordered this “new” and received it in very thin plastic packaging. I opened it to look at the set to make sure they were all there. I noticed that disc 7 was a black disc and not the movie graphic that was on the other 7 discs. I took it out and looked at the bottom. It was very obviously used and has wear and scratch marks on the bottom. I contacted Amazon who did give me voucher to buy another new one of just disc 7. I thought that was fair. Now I have started watching the movies and they are all starting in odd places of the movies, which tells me that they were also used. So now I paid for it to be new only to find out the entire thing was used and just repackaged. I would strongly suggest not buying anything from the seller.  Very disappointing.

  The boxset itself is neat and the movies are gorgeous on blu ray. However, the discs are faulty. I've tried watching the first four HP movies now and each one has scenes that freeze and then skip entirely. I've tried using the discs in 3 seperate blu ray players as well as a PS4 and the problems occur in each one. I wanted to send it in for a replacement but the only option I have is refund which I do not want because I bought this set on sale and a refund would not allow me to afford the entire set again.

  When you are this far in your search for a perfect Harry Potter movie companion to your book collection, you should not settle for anything less than this 31 Disc collection with all the extra features and Blu Ray expansions on the Wizarding world.The package is nice and cozy to place in a bookcase and has all features of the Ultimate versions and the 8 Part documentary about the making of these movies. If you are confused I would say spend the extra bucks for all the features for this collection and in case you are looking for just the movies but the 4K or Blu Ray stand-alones and miss all the fun of owning this masterpiece.Oh and it is super easy to download the  movies on to your Vudu account and watch and re-watch at a button’s press. So that’s that! Stay Magical!

The logos stamped on the front of each disc isn't consistent or even look legit. Some of them have the logo half on and half missing. I'm very dissatisfied and disappointed.

They don’t look like previously described “burned copies” but rather the factory messed up ones.

  I bought these for $80 on Prime Day - I had been checking since Christmas but the price was always around $130, so this was a good deal for 4K. The most important part to me was that it included digital and I was disappointed that it did not the first time. However, I chatted with Amazon customer service and had a new box arrive within less than 24 hours and this time it DID include digital - it said the codes expired, but it worked fine on MoviesAnywhere (which can be connected to Vudu, Prime Video, etc). I noticed the box this time specifically mentioned digital while my first did not (see picture), so it must just be luck.

I decided to just move on to the next one Goblet of Fire got about halfway through and it skipped so bad my DVD player stopped playing it. Cleaned it put it back in and skipped.

Three of the remaining 5 DVDs played thru the entire movie but hung up several times. Happily, two out of the bunch played perfectly. Overall the full, 8 DVD set is most unsatisfactory product.

  Ok let me start by saying I realize that these are a great deal especially since I scored them for Black Friday (blueray for about 30) but you get what you pay for. That being said, the quality of the DVDs is seriously lacking, it’s grainy at some points and some of the sound is off at times. The DVDs themselves are a mismatch of various dvd covers, some with “disc one” written on them and some without, not all of them were centered on the DVD. They definitely do not look like a matching boxed set- some of them have bonus features and others do not. Despite all of the negatives we are keeping them because they are for the kids who I know are already rough on DVDs. If you are an enthusiast who is looking for a good boxed set, this is not for you.

  I think this would have been a good product if it was actually HD DVD quality. I started watching the first movie and I was so disappointed with the quality of the dvd, it was grainy at some points and the audio was not clear. The bootleggers in my country have better copies of this movie for much less money. This is definitely not the original DVD’s from Warner Brothers. Not worth it!

  [This is a review of this particular set, not the Harry Potter series, which on a scale of 1-10, would be a 9 3/4]This set is really nice. It is one case, containing 1 disc for each film. There are some special features included on the discs, but the down side is that if purchased individually, you would get an extra disc with additional content.Another thing to note, is that this set is not consistent across all discs. All discs have similar images on them with the exception of the Half Blood Prince, which is notably different looking, and starts with two annoying previews.Other than those things, it's a really nice set, that any HP fan would love to have.

  Best thing ever. Perfect for the ""grown up"" Potterhead. I desperately wanted that ultimate Wizard's collection that came in the many-compartmented box with all the trinkets and doodads, but it was always either sold out or way too expensive. I finally ""settled"" for this edition and I'm glad I did. As I've grown up, I'm starting to downsize my fandom collections to fit into my adult world a little better, and I would have wasted so much money on the trinket box. This is slim, sleek, easy to store or subtly display, and still full of cinema magic.

  We ordered this for our Potterhead son for Christmas. Because we only bought these to update his DVD set to a Blu-ray set, it sat wrapped up on the shelf until we decided to have a Potter weekend. Well, after removing the plastic covering and opening it up, I only found 7 discs! It was missing the first movie! Of course now it's too late to return, but I'll be contacting, reviewing, and doing everything I can to make this right. We were so excited to have every copy on blu-ray...UPDATE! We missed the holiday return policy date literally by 2 days...needless to say we are mad enough to use some unforgivable curses over here...

  I LOVE these movies. What I don't love is that they're widescreen. I also don't love the fact that the case is so cheaply made. the discs fall out all of the time. I've also notice that the sound quality is terrible. It gets really loud and really quiet all without touching the remote. It also sometimes will just stop making any sound at all. Sometimes we have to restart the whole tv and playstation just to hear it play. This does not happen with any other DVD we play. Pretty disappointed.

  The reason for giving a 5 stars is due to the outstanding service. The first order received had 1 disc damaged or defective. From the second order another disc was defective. Because I still had the order no. 1 I could swap the disc or I would have done the exchange process again which would have been annoying. Amazon didn’t give me any hard time at all for the return process.The price for the collection is a good deal but make sure not a long time passes before you watch them all.

  Films look amazing in 4K! So far I’ve watched 4 movies and they’ve played without issues. It’s awesome that this set also includes the blu-ray set so I can watch the movies on my non-4K TVs as well. However, for the price this set costs I was definitely disappointed when I saw the set had a tear in the cover. It looks like someone cut it with a knife. Unfortunately, this is the outer cover so it makes it look cheap with the cut in it. I’m not sure if this was something from the seller or happened in transit.

  Having read the books and listened to the audiobooks multiple times, you could say I'm a bit of a fan. I have always been a little disappointed in the movies because I always wanted them to be closer to the books, but that isn't possible due to time, nor does it may good movies. However, the full release versions include a few little tidbits that the theatrical releases don't, that add somewhat to the overall theme, and added a little more enjoyment. After watching them so many times, it is nice to see the full version and be a little startled when a scene pops up that I don't recognize. I highly recommend watching the full versions if you are into the story and want a bit more than what the base movie offers.

  Pros:Product was not damaged and was in excellent condition.Cons:The blu-Ray collection is a series of discs put together from their individual sale. They don’t all coincide. The first 5 are all just straight Blu-Ray movies. No menus or extras. You pop them in and they play. The last 3 all had Blu-Ray menus, extra content, and scene selection etc.One of the discs had problem staying in high definition. It was alternating between fuzzy and super clear throughout the whole movie. It was only this one disc, I believe Goblet of Fire.To be honest, I would deal with these cons if I didn’t pay over $40 for the collection. But at this point, I’d rather buy the individual Blu-Ray movies and know for a fact that I’ll get all the content and all the availability of menus with clear picture every time.

  We bought these movies to have something we could watch with our daughter. We chose this set to get blu-ray quality picture and sound at a low price, and this set delivered all of that. I didn't mind the single unit packaging as all of our discs are kept in a huge binder. It lost the 5th star because (as others have noted) it doesn't seem like a true set. The first 4 discs have no opening menu and the movie starts playing automatically. The last 4 discs have a menu bar at the bottom. You can access a variety of special features on the first 4 by hitting the ""pop-up menu"" button on the remote. After each feature the movie continues and you have to hit the menu button again. The last four have some ""making of"" footage but no deleted scenes or other fun stuff like the first 4 discs. Still a good deal as long as you don't mind missing a few special features.

  DVDs themselves are great, but man, the case is so flimsy and doesn't hold said DVDs well. The plastic teeth that grip the DVD holes aren't long enough, so the discs just pop off them at random.

  While the packaging for this affordable collection on blu-ray of Harry Potter films is sound enough, the discs themselves are somewhat strange. First, the sound is very low. I have to turn my television's volume to 100 to get it loud enough. Watching regular TV I have it set to 28. This is the case with all the discs. I don't have a 5.1 sound system, but it's still strange that the sound was mixed so low. Secondly, the movies start immediately upon inserting the disk. It gives no title menu to decide when you want to play it and no easy way to find chapters. At least there are no irritating previews and ads that are so standard now. Lastly, I am only through the first few movies but the extra features are intriguing but not in letterbox format. I assume they were filmed in standard size originally and they haven't adapted them; it's bothersome to have to switch the screen size on the TV depending on the feature. All these things are livable and the price is certainly right when on sale (though recently it seems like everyone had blu-ray Harry Potter for $10 a movie). It's been interesting to go back and watch all the movies in rapid succession and to see the improvement with every film and to watch the characters and the actors grow up right before our eyes. I recommend the collection for the price if on sale ($80), but I wonder if they're going to come out with a set in the future that'll have remastered sound, etc.

  These 8 films capture the remarkable journey of Harry Potter and his companions through a mystical world. Other reviewers have recapped the story so I will not attempt to restate these comprehensive reviews.The cinematography is vivid and sophisticated. Which leads me to my only disappointment with this BluRay collection: Some of the movies don't seem to be BluRay resolution. I feel like I'm watching a DVD in some cases. I've nonetheless rated it 4 stars.For those who are budget conscious, I'd think that buying the DVDs and watching them on an upconverting DVD player would give the same results as I'm seeing on this BluRay version of Harry Potter movies.After watching the BBC nature series on BluRay in eye-popping HD, I am hooked on seeing things just as the photographer saw them. In the case of the Potter series, I expected to see the films at home on my 1080p HDTV looking as sharp as they do in the theater.Sadly, you will not get the ""theater"" experience with these BluRays. Some discs are better than the others, and the quality varies from scene to scene.Overall, a great story with excellent cinematography, but disappointing resolution.

  The DVD set I received was odd. The DVd had no artwork on them and so looked amateur. There were scenes missing that I remember seeing on other sets; not any extended scenes but scenes that seemed to fit in normally. I don't think I'm explaining myself well, but it is disconcerting for one scene to suddenly jump into an unrelated scene.

  I bought this for my boyfriend's birthday because he mentioned that he liked it and read the books. We watched it on our PS4 when I went to visit and didn't have any issues with the disks or the quality (that we could tell). I highly recommend for anyone interested in watching or if you love the series. :)

  i have grown up with these movies, and are wonderful! However i gave this rating a 4 out of 5 because i bought it used like new, and just to inform those to be aware there will be scratches here and there. For the most part there was only one or two scratches at most per movie. Except there was one disc where it stopped 4 to 6 times but only for a few seconds and it never stopped entirely. Just be aware that the discs are great if you want to save $10 by not getting new, but expect a few scratches. (Also case was broken when i got it but hold them fine).

  This is an honest review for everyone looking to purchase this box set. To first point out, some of the discs I received have mismatched cover art. But, they are all the same. All the Blu-ray discs are brand new, freshly burned copy's of the movies. The quality was perfect. It just bugged me that 2 of the discs look different then the rest.The Blu-ray boxset is neat, nothing broken, scratched, or damaged. Again, the movie quality is fantastic. If you are looking to buy this to just soley watch the movies and not worry about having a perfect collection, then get this set. Otherwise, spend the money and buy it from a retailer that have all the discs looking to same.

  Harry Potter is simply one of those amazing stories that comes along only once a generation.  I first got into it when I myself was in the 8th grade, and have been following the stories and movies ever since.  It holds a special place in my heart, and so even though I’m a 32 year old male, I still consider myself a Harry Potter fan (although not admitted freely in public!).  This has been a great collection to own.  I replaced the DVDs I had with the entire set on blu-ray.  I don’t watch the movies very frequently any more, but every once in a blue moon I’ll get a craving for it, and it’s just so nice to have them all at my fingertips, and in hi-def nonetheless.  I’m not big into the special features, so I’ll let others talk about all that stuff.  All I’ll say is that the high definition quality is exactly what I had hoped it would be, and I couldn’t be happier.

Has anyone else had the issue where Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets have extended versions available on the menu of the Blu-ray discs, but none of the other movies do? I also cannot watch the Blu-ray disc of Chamber of Secrets or Goblet of Fire, after choosing ""Play movie"" on the menu, it cycles directly back to the menu. I'm extremely disappointed in the set, as I adore the books and movies and was very much looking forward to having this set with all the extras on Blu-ray.

  This is an amazing collection of all 8 films. With each school year, you get a Blu-ray Disc, a DVD, and at least one disc of special features. I got my set for $150 which is a ridiculously good price! If I were to go out at buy each DVD movie for $10 the cost would be $80. Then add in the Blu-Ray copies for $15 each and you get an additional $120 in cost. And THEN the special features would be at least another $40 totaling in about $240. $100 more than what I paid. The movies come in a great storage case themed as a book! It makes for a protective box an easy way to store 31 discs. The copy I received had a little damage to the outside of the box due to poor packaging/or shipping. But no movies were harmed! Great set!

Movie 3 shows Polar Express first but if you stop and start multiple times you eventually get Harry Potter movie.  Since the package was so reasonable priced we elected to deal with it.  Until movie 7 where the movie (at least until minute 16 when I turned it off in frustration) is a green screen with flashing black squares - there is sound but no viewable picture.  I can no longer get a refund but I urge you not to buy this DVD set from this supplier.  We will buy them individually from amazon for our viewing pleasure.

  I was missing two DVDs from the series because I bought them as VHS years ago and I wanted a box set that would look good on my bookshelf with my hardcover HP books and wands and golden snitch.  Nice presentation, wonderful franchise, and I have already watched the entire series twice all the way through since I bought this box set for myself.

  I bought these last year for my daughter who was just getting into Harry Potter. Two of the DVDs had significant skips and bugs in them the first time we played them and today, the first time we got ready to play movie 7 it won’t play at all. These have been essentially a waste of money. I had promised her we would watch it today, so I had to buy it again from Prime Video. Very disappointed.

  I bought this for my daughter and she enjoyed it but the picture was a bit fuzz and the volume was off.  We hard to turn the movie way higher than normal to watch.  however it played the movies in full and for the price it wasn't too bad.  She is happy to watch them but she is 11.

  Now I have to be honest, I was never a Harry Potter fan, I was more into Lord of the Rings when this was first released in theaters across the globe. I have never read any of the books nor watched one movie of Harry Potter. So the Mrs one day told me she loved Harry Potter and seen like one maybe two movies. So when I came across this on sale and complete collection and on  BluRay I decided to jump on it and order this collection. So after I have received the collection I literally watched a movie a day, one right after the other and man I do have to say could not get enough, I was so impressed with the movie and it so left me wanting more, I literally love this movie completely and it got me reading the books now. I'm now such a huge fan. Great Movie Completely!!! 2 Thumbs Up if I had 4 thumbs I would give it just that...

  At first I was in love with this product, it has everything an ultimate Harry Potter fan is looking for. The problem for me was that the discs came scratch both times, even the bluray dics. I asume it was because of the packaging. I was very disappointed because I really loved all of the content that came in this Harry Potter Collection. But is very difficult to enjoy a movie that skips constantly because of the damage.

  Overall exactly what you expect. The original 8 films on Blu-ray, all in one box, each on a separate disc to enjoy. The quality is good and the movies are of course great and a nice bit of nostalgia for people that grew up with them. The only thing I would say is missing are the bonus features that were present on the older films DVD releases. While you still get the deleted scenes on these older ones and commentary, the old game-type bonus features that I remember as a kid are unfortunately gone. There are remnants of these special features in the Blu-ray menus, but the entire games are gone. Overall, it’s a really great price for a product you’ll know you will love!

  I bought this set for my son's 21st birthday, believe it or not. My favorite part is we watched them together, so it gave us some quality time with each other. I bought the DVD set and really wish I had bought the Blue Ray set. I don't know why I didn't other than I didn't pay close enough attention. If you purchase the set and have a Blue Ray player,definitely go that route. It makes a huge difference in the picture quality. But, that is my error and has nothing to do with the product.

  I put the Blu Ray in and it immediately started playing the movie without any menu or in-movie menu to be able to add subtitles or closed captioning. I can only do the standard play, pause, etc. This, to me, seems like someone just recorded the movie, put it on a disc, and slapped on a Harry Potter sticker on it. I'm glad it's not region-restricted but that hardly makes it okay. Would not recommend if you want to change any languages or subtitles.Edit: after watching the remainder of the movies, it’s become apparent that these are merely poorly pirated editions and copied onto DVDs. DO NOT PURCHASE!

  I pre-ordered this version when it was first announced because I didn't care to have all the special features but still wanted the movies.  Since I knew a box set would be coming out, my patience has been somewhat rewarded by this product.  However, you do get what you pay for, and given the cheap per unit rate that I paid for (which is around $10 per movie), I am pleased with the purchase.It is disappointing to learn that this is just a repackaging of the existing Blu-ray discs that are currently in other sets, as well as the lack of proper representation of the disc art as photographed by the product image in this listing.  But these are just minor complaints.Again, I was not looking for a LOST style box set, with feelies and loads of extras that are just as long as the movies themselves.  I was looking for a collection that had all the movies so I could revisit and enjoy them all over again.  And for that, I'm happy with this purchase and this product.

  It was perfect. Had every disc in it ans none of them scratched. It was a good buy. :) I’m happy with it. It does pause for like .5 seconds to switch in the The second half of the movie. But it’s not like horribly noticeable. Like I said it’s basically like snapping your finger. That’s how quick the freeze frame is. It’s didn’t bother after we knew why it was happening but over all it’s was a great purchase ans well worth it.

  I love this series, and with the release of Fantastic Beasts, I knew I could no longer contain my frustration at not having the whole set. The one I purchased is just the DVD versions not the blue-ray or extended editions, but I really didn't need all the extras. I bought this over the cyber Monday sale for $24, but I plan to buy my mom a set for Christmas too and am completely comfortable with paying full price! It took about two weeks to arrive, and they were able to just pop the box right into my mailbox. I haven't had the chance to sit down and watch them yet, so I can't testify to the video quality of the DVD's, so when I do get around to it- I'll keep you posted!

Each film has 4 discs. 2 blu ray discs, one for the film one for special features about the entire series; a dvd copy of the film and a dvd of special features from the original dvd release of the film. There is also a digital code for the entire collection digital editions. Theres also a bonus bluray disc with extra special features following the final film! The whole thing is built into a hardcover Potter storybook format with each page consisting of a different film. Beautiful packaging and absolute heaven to own. Yes, only the first two films include an extended cut but thats just fine with me. I am so happy with this collection. No dissapointment at all. Worth every cent!

I haven’t played any of the movies yet but just by opnening the box I saw scratches and smudges on ALL the dvd discs. Some (like 3) of the even had scratches on the back (NOT A GOOD THING). Idk how long these dvds will last since they’ve obviously been used before but I wouldn’t want to give these as a present to anyone based on the conditions I’ve received them in. Based on the reviews, I can tell this doesn’t happen often since everyone here seems pretty satisfied with their purchase.

  My son was reading the books and as he finished each book we would watch the accompanying movie. We purchased the box set knowing we would eventually watch them all. Everything went well until the last DVD. It skipped, and would not play properly. We tried cleaning the disk, though it did not help.  All of the other movies played fine. We reached out to the seller; they did not respond. We were just past the return time period or we would have returned this item. It is a major downer to go through all of the books & movies only to reach the end and not be able to watch it.

Each movie includes a main menu where you can select languages or closed captions according to your preferences, without struggling with the remotes. They are English and Spanish dub, and has English, Spanish and French CC. The movies have a great quality image too. For this price, it's a must buy!

  The quality of the Blurays is exceptional. Unfortunately, the box they came in was in tatters. The front cover of the clamshell was broken at the binding, and several of the disks consistently fall out due to faulty fastenings. I purchased the most affordable box set, and it certainly seems like that.

  I only had the first movie before so I bought this set and I question the legitimacy of it. The dvd images were very dull in color compared to the other one and the images were slightly doubled, almost like it was too dull to tell what it was so someone tried again.

  I only had the first movie before so I bought this set and I question the legitimacy of it. The dvd images were very dull in color compared to the other one and the images were slightly doubled, almost like it was too dull to tell what it was so someone tried again. There’s no ads for any other movies, it just goes straight to the menu.

  Yes, this may be considered a no frills box set, but I don't care!  Since I never bought any of the individual movies on DVD, this was the most economical way to own all 8 parts.  I liked the way the disks were packaged in one case.  The minimalist packaging makes for easy access to the disks & doesn't take up any more space then 2 DVD cases.  All 8 disks played great.  There were no playback issues.  Parts 7 & 8 did contain deleted scenes.  Otherwise each disk is one movie & some theater trailers.  After seeing all the low ratings I thought there were quality issues, but this is not the case.  The bad reviews seem to focus on the lack of special features & the UK having a better Blu-ray box set.  It just seems some people won't be happy no matter what box set WB puts out.  Overall, if you are looking for all 8 Harry Potter films, this is a great deal!  This set was about $40 dollars when I purchased it.  The price has gone up in the last week.  It may be cheaper to buy individually now.

  I'm a Potter-head--a middle-aged fan.  I got involved with the books and movies because my sons were reading the books.  I heard a lot of bad press about the books/movies from a few religious groups, and I thought I better check them out before I let my sons continue reading the books.  I found nothing wrong with the books or movies, and I fell in love with the world of Harry Potter.  (Although religion isn't addressed in the book, there is the universal theme of good versus evil; love triumphs over hate; and self sacrifice for others is the ultimate Christ symbol, so I had no problem reconciling my faith with the books/movies.)  My individual DVD's were getting ragged (I can watch the movies numerous times), so I wanted an entire set.  This is a sleek, thin collection that fits in my storage cabinet easily (I can now retire my older DVD's and have more room to spare!).

  I enjoyed watching the ""Harry Potter"" films during their first-runs in the theaters, and again on Blu-ray.It was something of a surprise to see and hear how *young* the actors and actresses were at the beginning of the films when compared to the last film. The earlier films didn't quite add up to how I remembered them in the theater, but the mid- and late-stage films did. Characters that stood out to me — aside from the ""core"" three — included, but were not limited to, Dumbledore, Ginny Weasley, Hagrid, the Malfoys and, of course, Voldemort.One last note: I haven't had time to read the books the movies are based on, but if the films are any indication, the books should be on par or even better than the movies. After all, it's common knowledge that films often sacrifice the ""smaller"" aspects of book-based stories in order to fit into a 2-hour or so viewing timeframe.So, yes, if you have the funds, by all means go ahead and purchase the ""Harry Potter"" films on Blu-ray.

Also, most of the dvds had scratches on the faces (not the part that is played by your dvd player). Yes, I bought this new but couldn't return it because it didn't qualify for a return.

Not sure what it was but these didn’t feel like blu rays granted I’ve only checked on out specifically goblet of fire since I figured it was far enough in to have some good visuals but it was underwhelming compared to other blu rays I own. Maybe the last films have the blu ray visual I’m looking for. Also the sound is a bit low maybe that’s just how they are but I had to turn my tv and sound system up more than usual.Anyway for the price I paid I’m not disappointed in my purchase I’ll enjoy the films.

The one caution is that there seems to be an incompatibility in format between the American and European versions for some of the bonus materials.  When you order:  American version, the first movie is SORCEROR'S stone.  European, PHILOSOPHER'S stone.

These movies are great quality and play well. The discs work great in our player. A couple of the movies - Year 7 - appears to have special features, which is great!It's a wonderful collection - it comes in a standard sleeve with 4 DVD cases - two DVDs per case. For example, the first and second films are in the same DVD case, and so on. The last film (both parts) are in a case of their own with what appears to be two special features discs.The entire product came shrink-wrapped, and appears to be brand new. I love it!

I bought this set because it comes with the same discs as the set for $500+ but at a fraction of the cost. I don't get the cool case and the little extra's, but I am completely happy with the set I got for this price!

  I got this set for my birthday on a cyber Monday sale. I actually bought it for myself because my muggle husband does not understand my obsession... Shipping was super fast and I got an amazing deal! All of the movies are in one case which is only slightly thicker than a standard blue ray case. This was perfect for me and my lack of DVD storage space. This being my all time favorite set of movies makes it impossible for me to say anything negative. I am the ultimate Harry Potter nerd and I make no apologies!I am what I am an’ I’m not ashamed. ‘Never be ashamed,’ my ol’ dad used ter say, ‘there’s some who’ll hold it against you, but they’re not worth bothern’ with.’

Since A legitimate corporation sold me this and I technically purchased set. Would this give me a right or decriminalize if I torrent the movies I don't have and suppose to?

  This was a birthday gift for my wife because she's a huge Potter fan. I was never interested in watching any of these movies, so I decided that I was gonna watch all of them with her & really try to enjoy myself as part of the gift experience. The cover art is beautiful. Very sturdy case & plenty of special features to keep you busy for days. The slip covers are similar to the Bond 50 collection, only easier to take out. I only wish it had a commemorative book to accompany the movies.Getting the collection in Blu ray, DVD & digital copy is great. Plus, we get to add two more 3D movies to our collection since The Deathly hallows is also included in 3D format.Now the reason I rated it three stars is because although I loved the packaging & the hours & hours of special features, I didn't really like the movies. I found myself bored at times. (Don't tell my wife though) They felt very long. Don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of 3+ hour long movies like Lawrence of Arabia, Cleopatra or Ben-Hur but no matter how hard I tried, I just couldn't get into these movies so they seemed long to me. If I had bought this collection for myself & hadn't watched them with my wife, I probably would have rated this collection one star, but seeing how much joy it gave her to give me all the details of every character, made it worth watching. If you're a real fan then you probably already own these on Blu ray & I don't think spending $100 - $150 for special features alone is worth that price. My wife had them on DVD so I decided to upgrade her collection. It made her very happy. Making her smile was worth $99.

  The complete 8 movie set for $50 was a real bargain, so perhaps I shouldn't complain. And I certainly didn't expect any bonus features or special items often included in individual DVD sets, but after watching the first four movies again from this collection (I had seen them earlier on TV) I was rather disappointed that certain scenes are missing in these editions.For example, in ""The Chamber of Secrets"" the scene where Harry accidentially lands in Dervish & Banges instead of Diagon Alley and witnesses Lucius Malfoy selling items from his forbidden collection is not included. And in ""Goblet of Fire"" the scene where Snape rounds up students making out in the carriages during the Yule Ball is also not included.Otherwise it is a great collection and worth the money, but die hard fans may want to get all scenes when they buy the movies.

  After watching the first 5 discs with no problem, I was very disappointed to find out that the last two discs would not play audio in English on on my Blue Ray player.  The first five discs used Dolby audio for English.  The last two used DTS for English which will not play on my player.  Interestingly enough, the other languages on the last two discs did use Dolby audio and would play on my player.  Unfortunately, I only understand English.  Why two different audio systems would be included in the same package of discs is beyond me.  And yes, my Blue Ray player firmware is up to date.

  For clarification, this is for the 31-disc Hogwarts Collection (the book-style one, not the huge box).While I'm very pleased with 90% of the quality of this collection, one part crucial to longevity has sadly been overlooked by the manufacturer.  The spine of the book containing the discs has no reinforcements and is very thin, and as a result is very flimsy.  It almost feels like after a just a few uses it might start tearing.  The book and the sleeve it sits in are both very beautiful, the discs are perfect quality, and the hours of extra behind-the-scenes footage are a great addition to this post-Mainstream-Harry-Potter-movie world.  If you enjoy watching extended versions of movies, this has the first two released (there's something with a distributor or something that is preventing extended versions of 3-8 being released) and/or enjoy watching everything that went in to making these fantabulous movies but don't want to pay $500+ for the Wizarding Collection (the giant box one), I'd highly recommend this set.  Just be careful with letting small children and clumsy people handle it...

  Harry Potter is an awesome series but these DVDs my wife bought were scratched and sometimes skipped whole scenes. Will definitely be buying digital copies next time. She wanted to save some money and go with the DVD set... learned our lesson. Really sucks that these were brand new and scratched right out of the box :( wish we would have watch them as soon as we got them so we could  return them.

  Let the HP marathon begin! There is so much extra content with this box set you'll have plenty to watch for dayyys. My husband got this for me on Christmas of 2016 and it is seriously one of my favorite treasures I have! It was hard to justify the $100+ purchase as I already owned all of the movies, but now that I have it I would spend the money in a heart beat.  Harry Potter fans will not be disappointed :)

  I ordered the non-blu-ray version and it works perfectly! I've watched all DVDs and although they don't have any graphics on them (not a big deal to me) there are no scratches, skips or imperfections. I think 2-3 discs have special features but the majority do not. So if that's what you are looking for this isn't the set for you.They come in one case and you can flip through the DVDs like a book. A great space saver.I'm very happy with this purchase especially since I no longer have to record the movies and then fast forward through the commercials.

The rest of the DVDs skipped so badly that it made watching them futile.Returned the first set of DVDs. Recieved the second thinking I had just got a bad batch of DVDs.

One thing I do have an issue with is the way the discs are packed into this boxset (see the second photo above for reference). other than the way the discs are packed I see a TON of value in this boxset! Especially at the price it's going for right now.

  Ugh. Low stars is for the disks themselves. Movies are great themselves. I have no clue if the disks or my DVD player or stupid overzealous copy protection are the culprit. But I can not get some of these disks to play. I have to jump through a lot of hoops. Usually turn the player on and off a couple times. Then I can almost never choose Play Movie on the menu screen. But I can usually go to Choose scene and get it to play from there. Very frustrating. I have a newer Samsung BD-J6300 Blu Ray Player.

  Ordered this set and had it sitting on a shelf, untouched. Opened it and several of the trays that each of the disks sit in were previously damaged to the point where the trays completely obliterated the back of almost every disk. 4 of the 8 disks are irreparable and you can't watch more than 10 minutes before it skips halfway through the movie. I'd give ZERO stars if I could.

  As a long-time fan of Harry Potter, I'm excited to get my hands on all of the special features that the 31-disc set includes! It's an amazing collection I'm sure I'm going to have fun watching over the next few weeks.I do have to note, however, that my box set came with very obvious damage. Some corners were bent and crumpled, there were nicks and cuts along the surfaces, and the back of the box had a rather large tear right along an edge. Those are the only things stopping me from giving 5-stars, as one would usually expect a higher quality from a collector's edition like this.

  This is a complete set of the movie and for the price could not be beat if all you want are the movies.There are no special features, it is just the movies. For some reason, a few of the disks started to play right away without having me push play. Not a big deal, just thought I would mention it if you are intending to walk out of the room! One disk confused us by starting with an unlabeled ""Polar Express"" preview. This was the third or fourth disk (none of the others had any previews) so at first I thought it was the wrong movie! Just kind of weird so I thought I would mention that too.

No trailers or adds on the Blu-ray when loading, no BD-Live loading tralers for you, no having to hit menu or skip or fast forward, it just plays the movie.Also when stopping, at least with our Samsung player, it remembers where it left off and starts playing (just like DVDs), again, no hassles, not setting bookmarks, etc., it remembers where it left off and starts playing.We also have a 5.1 surround system and the sound quality and mixing is excellent.So we are very happy with our purchase and also enjoying watching the movies again at home and at a good price for the set from Amazon.

  1) DVDs looked nothing like the photos listed by the company 2) they skip terribly right at the most important parts 3) the movie gets so dark that it looks like I'm watching a blacked out screen.All of these make it clear that this are bootlegged and poor quality ones at that! So utterly disappointed. Would give 0 stars if I could

  We were excited to get these and was disappointed to find that the inserts that held the discs were broken. If that was it it wouldn’t have been a big deal. When we started one of the movies we found that these new movies had tons of scratches on them which caused the disc to skip and rendered the movie unwatchable. Be aware before buying

  Liked the price and all of the DVDs and gave as a gift to my son who’s a huge fan. Second movie kept glitching and skipping and I looked at disc and it was clearly scratched in several spots. Started looking thru the rest of the set and 4 other untouched discs were heavily scratched. Got refund and new set came and of all the discs only one is scratched.. but still. It’s irritating bc we haven’t even taken them out of case to watch. Keeping second set bc I’m sick of returning.

  I am adding this review not of the movies but of the quality of the Blu-Ray disks in the hopes that I can save others some trouble. We got these just to have the movies, we love the books but are not die-hard movie fans. We are now on our second set, and disk 7 has serious (not Sirius) flaws. The video and audio are out of sync in a significant portion of the film. In both cases, it was the part where Ron, Hermione, and Harry have been captured by snatchers and turned over to the Malfoy/Black family. Loads of close ups with long speeches, the audio being out of sync here completely ruins these scenes. The first set we had, the sync problem extended from the Ron Returns portion of the film through the beach scene. With the same problem in the same spot on the same disk (though slightly less duration the second time) I can only conclude there is a bad batch of these. I very much hope that the manufacturer simply had a bad day in quality control. I would hate to think they are passing these off in the multi-disk set.My kids love these, and I hate to return them. But even as cheap as they are (~ $10 per disk) it's just not worth it when one of the movies is rendered unwatchable.

  The 3rd dvd in this collection appears to be Prisoner of Azkaban, but when you put it in the dvd player, you're going to see Polar Express. I even asked for a replacement; same thing happened.Update: After being told that the 3rd dvd just jumps into a really long preview of Polar Express, I'm changing the review from 1-star to 4-star. It's pretty good for a 8-film collection. The only issue is that, although the fifth disc looks fine, it starts freezing up a bit about halfway through the movie. Just a little bit, on and off, for about 10 minutes; then it's fine again.

  I bought the 8-disc Blu-ray set and I love it. My favorite of the extras is the deleted scenes, so I was happy with everything this included. As for the movies themselves, seen one after the other they let the viewer see the progression through the years. The movies slowly get darker, although Delores Umbridge is the one who sends cold chills down my back.The movies have enduring themes of the value of friendship, finding courage when needed, and standing up to wrongdoers. They are well worth watching more than once.

I was, however, disappointed to discover that they are just the theatrical releases and contain no deleted scenes, which I had hoped they would.  If you want the extended versions (Director's Cut), you'll either have to buy them individually or get the multi-format collection.  Either way, be ready to cough up some green.  If you just want to get the whole set without extras, and have it all in one tidy package, this is it.

  It's all the Harry Potters...in a single set...in HD - need I say more? Amazon had the best price I could find and it arrived quickly (of course).My 7 y/o and I have thoroughly enjoyed working our way through this set - it's been a neat bonding experience. Harry's tale obviously became darker and more intense the further it went on. I deliberately held off on getting this set until I felt my 7 y/o could grasp most of the material...and not be too freaked out by the scary stuff. I wouldn't personally show it to any kids under 7ish - but your kids (and child rearing techniques) may vary.I can't really comment on the special features, etc...we've only focused on the actual movies so far.

Would certainly recommend this collection if you are a Harry Potter fan.  Only reason that we bought the DVD collection over the Blu Ray collection is that we currently have more DVD players in the house than Blu Ray players.  Can't go wrong either way.

  Seven out of the eight films work with no issue. They play great, the sound and visual quality is wonderful, and I was pleased with my purchase. The last film (Deathly Hallows Part Two) was corrupted. The screen would pixelate and the sound was distorted.I put in a request for a replacement, and it arrived within a few days. I checked the DVDs for quality and once again the same DVD was corrupted. I called Amazon's customer service and was told that there is no way of ensuring the quality of the product. In the end I decided to keep the original  purchase, send back the replacement, and I will replace the last DVD myself.I'm disappointed with the quality and the inconsistency of the product.

  We just spent the last week watching one of these movies every night, and we couldn't be more pleased with the set. We bought it during one of the holiday sales just so we'd finally own all the movies and didn't even think about added features and fancy cases. Every disc was in pristine condition all functioned as they should. I love that the case takes up less room than two regular DVD cases, too. I put it in my daughter's Christmas stocking, and she was thrilled. We'll have to get our own set when she goes away to college next year.

  I bought this over Black Friday because it was such a great deal on Amazon; am really enjoying watching all the Harry Potter movies back to back. I'm seeing so many details and character development and even scenes I don't remember seeing! It's great to have them all and be able to watch them whenever I want, as well as in order all at once. I don't like Harry Potter as well as Lord of the Rings or the Matrix (more adult-level fantasy/adventure), but these films are truly magical and I, like millions, have grown to love the characters and enjoy watching the story unfold. Each film is a complete adventure in and of itself but they all build on each other and give clues up until the final film. Really worth having.

  I've had this set for a bit over a month, apparently it is just past the return deadline, otherwise I'd ask for a refund.  I put them in my Blu-ray player for the first time to watch with our grandkids.  The discs skip constantly to the point the movie cannot be watched.  I first thought perhaps the disc player was going bad but when I inserted another of our movies it worked fine so the problem is apparently with the Harry Potter discs.

We have watched the first 6 movies and had no problems at all. The discs seem to be a bit different sometimes, however. Half-Blood Prince had a preview before the movie and a movie selection screen, while the other movies just went straight to the movie. I am very pleased with my purchase.

Everything was picture perfect, no problems. A few days ago, however, after inserting the third disc we were shocked to find The Polar Express playing on our tv. Quickly, I inserted the last few discs to see if there were any more that were defected, and surely enough the last 2 movies were a continuous cycle of advertisements. Truly disappointed in this purchase, especially for the price I paid.

This has every movie, as well as the 3D blu rays of the final movies and most importantly the extra discs for each movie that came with the pricy Ultimate Edition individual movie releases. The outer casing is very strong and the movies are stored in cardboard slots inside of a thick booklet.If you love the movies and are big into special features, this box set need is a must need.

  I'm writing this review mainly about the case that holds the DVDs (aka. Blu-rays). The case is really thick -not the problem- but the ""push"" buttons that hold the DVDs in the middle are extremely short and aren't tall enough to hold the DVDs strongly. Flipping the DVDs flaps causes the DVDs to fall out of grip. I would recommend getting a different set if you have the money for it. Because only time will tell if the DVDs constantly being loose will ruin them.

  I am not going to comment on the movies but will concentrate on the boxed set. If you are looking for the collector's edition this is NOT the item you are looking for. There is another collector's box available that you can get with all the bells and whistles. This box set, however, had what I needed. All the HP movies in blu-ray without any special features, extraneous bonus materials etc. The box that the movies come in is sturdy and the movies are protected well enough in the box. At first the box looked small to contain all the eight movies, but upon opening, they were not only all there but neatly packed into their cover. Overall I would rate this a good product if you are looking for just the movies in blu-ray. The packaging was nice and I got what I needed.

At first the box looked small to contain all the eight movies, but upon opening, they were not only all there but neatly packed into their cover. Overall I would rate this a good product if you are looking for just the movies in blu-ray. The packaging was nice and I got what I needed.

  I love these movies, but the volume of the sound was extremely low in my dvd player. I had to really jack it up, and even then, couldn't hear everything. I hate leaving negative reviews but I am not happy with this product.

  These are very poor quality! Blurry/grainy picture. I am very disappointed as we use amazon for a TON of stuff!! I have never had to do a bad review, but for $65 I expect a good product. These will be returned as I am not happy and my son deserves are real product as this was a Christmas gift. Not cool!

  I am a big Harry Potter fan, and so is my wife. I have read all the books, and I have watched all the movies several times. I still enjoy watching them from time to time. The disks were all healthy. The quality is awesome. There's quite a lot of ""bonus features"" although some people think it's not enough (there are of course those who don't care about the bonus features at all.)The only thing that I wish was better regarding this item was the packaging. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with it, but it looks a bit cheap compared to some other collections that I have previously purchased from WB.

  I am very happy with this Harry Potter set. I didn't own any of the movies nor had I yet installed a Blu-ray player, so it was perfect to get. I wanted something with all the movies, tons of special features, and packaging that I can put on my movie shelf. The packaging itself is great and contains beautiful artwork. The book that contains the discs does look like it will wear and tear with age and use, but I don't really mind this. I also don't mind that movies 3-8 don't have extended editions. I have tried a majority of the discs on my new Blu-ray player, and they have all worked. I haven't tried the Ultraviolet service yet though since I don't really care too much for it. One thing that I did notice when looking at the discs is that a few of them had small scratches right when I took them out. This hasn't affected their use, however.At first I wanted to purchase the Wizard's Collection, but the price was too much. I also missed out on the $150 Costco deal for it last winter. However, even if I did buy it, I wouldn't know where to put it since the box is huge. I bought this set for around $170, which I think is a good deal. The Hogwarts Collection in my opinion is a great, cheaper alternative to the Wizard's Collection if you can live without all the supplemental memorabilia. It's more practical too since it's not too big or bulky, and it can be placed on a shelf alongside one's other movies. This one fits right in with my Blu-ray collection.

But, I didn't want to buy the set that didn't have any of the documentaries or special features and, personally, packing is very important to me and I didn't like the way the set with all the pictures of Daniel Radcliffe looked. But, then I found the ""Hogwarts Collection"" and fell in love with the packing and all the special features.  It includes all the movies on blu ray and DVD plus the ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" documentary. Overall, very happy with this purchase.

  The set is pretty amazing. The UV code I received says it needs to be redeemed by 3/4/16. I tried to redeem it anyway because it says it was extended til 2019. This is the main reason I bought it. So what am I to do now?

  Love being able to watch this anytime! I only wish they had made extended scene options for the rest of the films. When marathons are on TV, they always have the extended scenes. Still, it doesn't ruin the movies not to have them. :)

  For the most part I’m happy, just because I love having all the Harry Potter movies in a set on blu-Ray, but they’re not the best quality...I really don’t like that there’s no main menu, and some discs have a hard time starting, or it’ll just freeze mid-scene. Sometimes whole scenes are skipped, important ones. I should have paid a little extra money and bought them elsewhere....

  I am a huge Harry Potter fan and was so excited to find the whole collection of movies for such an awesome price. After watching these dvds I was very disappointed to find that several of the disks were scratched! It made it impossible to watch past a certain point. I wish I could return these and invest the money into a better (probably more expensive) set.

  Bought these for $34.99 the day after black friday 2014. By the time Cyber monday came along, this same Blu-Ray set was $54.99. Shame on Amazon for price gouging. Just goes to show that you can get better deals on days other than Black Friday/Cyber Monday, if you'll just look.It's nice to have the Blu-Ray of all 8 films. I have all 8 on DVD as well, but wanted to get them on Blu-Ray and let the kids have the DVDs, or maybe pass them on to someone else.This set is Region 1, and does have a few special features and isn't just the theatrical releases only.

  An incredible set for any Harry Potter fan. Contains a jaw dropping 32 discs with tons and tons of special features to enjoy for hours. Laid out in a nice book with envelope style slid in discs, this is the ultimate Harry Potter set for a reasonable price. My only issue with it is that the book's spine can easily be torn and has to be cared delicately, which is not a problem for me but might cause issues for others.

  It goes without saying that the Harry Potter series of movies had all the elementsfor great entertainment. The kids were good actors when this started and watching them mature into their talent is a treat we usually don't get except in television series.I love the films. I couldn't believe what a steal this was to purchase all the movies at such a price.

  It goes without saying that the Harry Potter series of movies had all the elementsfor great entertainment. The kids were good actors when this started and watching them mature into their talent is a treat we usually don't get except in television series.I love the films. I couldn't believe what a steal this was to purchase all the movies at such a price.

  I bought this as a gift and we watched all of them in one sitting. It took forever but was quite the fun experience. I couldn't believe how much I actually enjoyed these movies as I thought they were for kids. I was wrong, these have a lot of good things to say in them all the while being very entertaining to watch. Nothing gets dragged out for too long really and I was pleasantly surprised to see that Ralph Fiennes was the actor doing the part of Voldemort! This set is fun for the whole family!

  Poor quality DVD's. This video quality of these movies is horrible to thr point you want to turn the movie off. I'm playing the disc on my PS4 which works great for all my other DVD's. I'm guessing these are overseas rips due to the video quality. Don't waste your time on these and look for another seller

  THIS IS NOT A REAL SET! Something is wrong with these discs! The special features are impossible to navigate or even find for that matter. They pop up after the credits and will not show you what you are selecting. There is no play menu the movie just starts when you put it in the player. Ive noticed the audio is extremely low, I have to turn my TV up way past normal to hear them. The discs seem plucked from other sets, like they dont belong in a set together.

  As far as I can tell all the movies are fine and undamaged. When I took off the plastic wrap I found that the plastic case had breaks around the spine in the plastic and even through the paper cover art. One of the holders had one of the center pieces missing too, so it doesn't hold the disk quite right. The reason I say manufacturing is becuase the plastic wrap seemed undamaged. Again, the discs themselves seem to be safe and undamaged.

  I am so angry, I received this in the mail today and was super excited until I tried to play it. First, I tried to play it on my computer but, couldn't because it required interactive player which I then installed and still couldn't because it said there was an issue with my video subsystem. Now this took me and hour to try to fix and still couldn't. So I decided to try my dvd player and it played but, the voice audio was practically nonexistent because I had to increase my TV volume to 75 just to hear the dialogue while the background music and sound effects was at 75 volume. Safe to say I'm returning this piece of garbage that was most likely a copy and not original back to amazon and just buying it straight from Warner Bros' shop.

  The movies are good, im sure you've all seen them. The special features present on other dvds are not present here. On top of that. The packaging is horrendous. 8 dvds in one case. Jammed in there. Ideally each movie would have its own case, but 2 movies a case would have also been acceptable. 8 dvds in one case is just ridiculous, as box sets are often made for collectors, this is a big deal. You want a good box set, you can get the first 5 movies in a big collectors case(looks like a little suitcase, comes with lots of other cool little trinkets and whatnot), for only 20 dollars on amazon right now. If only the same amount of effort was made with this collection.

  The only difference between this used set and a set new from the store would be the missing cellophane wrapper.  Hat's off to the seller.The set itself holds a few disappointments with the quality of the earlier movies. They are far from unacceptable, but they are certainly NOT blu-ray definition, although they bear the blu-ray label.  Maybe that's as good as it gets for the older ones?  Seems to me like those movies are recent enough that they should be able to be presented much better than they are. Still, they are ""Durn Good Def"", the later movies are flawless and 8 movies for $40 is still a great deal.

  The movie set was not at all what I expected. It comes in a set that looks like an oversized regular DVD case, with individual disc holder ""pages."" All 8 discs were in there but it was weird. Each disc looked like it was taken out of the case from that individual movie... Most discs were normal and just said the title on it, but one of them had the movie poster image on the disc. Also, a couple discs said ""Disc 1"" on them, like they were taken out of their original movie cases that had a special features disc and just put into this case.

  Really great deal if you're missing multiple movies or don't have them! I have them all, but was missing one and a couple others have been skipping, so by the time I would be buying 2 or 3 of them, I would be spending more. Very worth the money! Good to keep it all together, too.

  My daughter introduced me to Harry Potter (the books, not the guy) earlier this year.  I'm in my mid-60s, and didn't think I'd be hooked.  Well... I was wrong.  I read all the books in a few weeks, then ordered this collection.I didn't need, nor did I want, any of the extra stuff.  All I wanted were the movies.  They arrived in good shape, and in a container that's more than adequate.  I've watched all the movies and the quality is great.  I suppose it doesn't hurt that I look like Dumbledore...

  I actually caught this set on sale during the black Friday sales, so I was really stoked at the price. I bought this as a gift for someone in my family. It isn't the individual DVD cases with the discs, it pans out and has all the discs in it. I think it's perfect for traveling and it's easier to grab which one you want to watch because they are all in there together! Great buy in my opinion.

  Undoubtedly there will be a new edition which is better than this one, but so far I've completely please with the entire set. Loads of special features (although let's be honest, there's YouTube for that now) and it's nice to have them all in one nice package. It's not so big that you can't fit it in a drawer, but quite nicely organized. I've adored this series since I began reading the books at age 12 and although the series can't stand up to the brilliance of the books, I'm still quite happy to now own the set

  I ordered the Harry Potter Set from Amazon a few weeks before Christmas. These discs seemed to be a bargin price compared to other stores. This set was delivered really fast using Amazon's Free Super Savers shipping, for orders over $25.  This collection has been a hit at our house. My family first watched them all in order. Now, we have been watching them in no specific order. We don't ever seem to ""burn out"" on watching Harry Potter. I liked watching Harry grow from a naive boy to a powerful wizard. I first saw these movies years apart at the theater. So, it was great to review them all again. This time I could put the whole Harry Potter puzzle together, for a better understanding. Now, my favorite movie is Harry Potter and The Deathly Hollows part II. Some of the supporting characters get their shining moments and you find yourself cheering them on. We have the DVD set and have not had any problems with the quality of these movies after numerous plays. My family doesn't mind that this set didn't come with alot of frills or is not commemerative. The packaging has a nice cover and a brief synopsis of each disc on back. They come in a plastic holder that houses all eight discs. I would highly recommend this set to all Harry Potter fans.

  Great, compact set. Each disc is not in it's own box, but I like it that way. The only thing is I wish I had known that there are no extra scenes on these. We had previously watched a friend's DVDs that were each in their own boxes (purchased separately) and they had the extra scenes. Nothing is missing that impacts the story, but my daughter was like, what the heck?! It was still worth saving the money over more expensive options.

  I'm a huge fan of Harry Potter and when this Blu Ray set went on Cyber Monday sale it was too good to pass up. Movies 1-5 were perfect in sound and picture. The picture is crystal clear and vibrant and the sound is smooth and even; I never had to adjust the volume once. I could clearly hear the softer parts of the movie and the action scenes were not too loud. For some reason movies 6-8 were very much lacking in the sound department. In order to hear softer scenes I had to turn the volume up about 50% which resulted in the louder, action scenes practically blowing me out of my sofa! It's such a shame too. It seems like the title screens on movies 6-8 are also formatted differently, which I suspect is the reason why the sound is off. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be, but clearly the sound is not true Blu Ray quality on the last 3 movies. Even though the first 5 are perfect, the fact that 3 of the movies in the set are off ruins it completely. It makes the movies unenjoyable when you have to adjust the sound every 10 minutes.

  All the right disks, good quality sound and picture. While I did enjoy watching these, I had a vague sense I was missing something, Halfway through I realized these are not the full theatrical versions. That was a disappointment. I'm sure others agree, once you've seen the full version, these leave you with a thirst for the real thing. But I am certainly not willing to spend even more at this point. Really the description should have stated these are edited versions. It certainly isn't ethical to leave that out.

  The 8-disc set arrived right on time and was in great condition.  I was a little concerned that the box was too thin, but inside all of the discs are held in their own nice little plastic sleeves that you can flip through--very convenient and it saved a lot of space compared to each disc in its own individual box(less likely to lose one that way too).  I bought this as a gift for my little sister and she absolutely loves it. She has watched all of the movies in a two day span.  We already had one of the movies but this was a much more cost effective way to get the rest of them.  Great product and got a great deal!!

  Great collection for one who might do a marathon or simply wants all of the special features.

  Great collection for one who might do a marathon or simply wants all of the special features. My only beef is that this is obviously not custom made for a whole set so there is a ton of repetition and spoilers in the actual special features discs. I'd recommend watching them After the movies if you've never seen them before.*Note: I test all my movies before their return period, so I was the dummy who watched in the order the box stores them. :-p

  The 8 film collection that has Hogwarts on the cover suffers from Audio Delay. Audio and Video do not sync at separate times on all discs. Reading the other poor reviews and chances of possible counterfeiting, I advise to buy another version elsewhere.5 star movies, 1 star execution on Blu-Ray

  I think the Amazon review system is fantastic.  It has helped me purchase and avoid purchasing numerious items.However on something like the Harry Potter collection...lets be honest.  Either you like these films or you don't.  Nothing I can say will be any more info than what you already know.Personally I enjoyed being able to watch the entire series as the characters grew from kids to adults, rather than watching a string of different actors portray the different ages.  I guess that is one thing unique to this collection...continuity beyond compare.

  My wife loves the Harry Potter movies so I purchased this Blu-Ray collection as a stocking-stuffer surprise for Christmas. She loved it, and over the course of the next month, we watched all eight movies. Beautiful, clear, near-3D Blu-Ray productions of the versions we saw in the theater. We never watch the interviews, etc., so this collection was a perfect gift for the amount I paid for it. The attractive plastic case contains all eight movies in a convenient arrangement. I know some folks are waiting for the release later this year of a super special-edition, but the set I ordered is really all you need for owning, watching and enjoying the Potter collection in Blu-Ray.

  I bought this a few weeks ago when the price was $35. I wasn't sure what to expect for such a low price, but I was pleasantly surprised. So far, I haven't come across any major problems. The only things I've noticed that could annoy some pickier people are: some of the movies are full screen and some are widescreen; the first few movies are definitely from when they were first released (they're not as great as quality as DVD's that have come out more recently, but nothing to really complain about); the 3rd one does have the previews at the beginning, but you can press menu and skip them just like with any other DVD. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and it's definitely worth the lower price to own all 8 movies.

  The sixth disc is scratched and skips a few seconds. It arrived this way. I am a responsible adult, none of my other dvds or video games have scratches. I did not return for a number of reasons. (1 I worked in retail, so I do NOT like returns, 2 Because I was working and didn't watch right away I may have missed the return date anyways, 3 I find the trouble of trading out the disc for a $5 dvd at Target a cheaper solution). I always enjoy watching Harry Potter, therefore the 4 star review. Only recently I've came upon the special features which appeared following the film. I am pleased with the amount of features presented, and have learned a few things and find the material and subjects interesting.

  With this complete collection of Harry Potter films, you get exactly that, the films. They are great of course, but all the extra bells and whistles are left to be desired for. They have little things, like the making of, or commentary on each disc, but nothing spectacular.

  With this complete collection of Harry Potter films, you get exactly that, the films. They are great of course, but all the extra bells and whistles are left to be desired for. They have little things, like the making of, or commentary on each disc, but nothing spectacular.

  The Blu-Ray 8-Film Collection came as advertised with all 8 discs brand new. It was a great deal on Black Friday and am happy with the purchase. I visited the Harry Potter Studios in the U.K. and had not seen all the movies so this was perfect. There are extras on the discs but I am not sure how comprehensive it is as stand-alone discs. You will not get the amount of fancier disc packaging and potentially extras as a stand-alone discs but in exchange you get all 8 films for a lower bulk price. Whether it is a personal purchase or a gift for someone else, it is a great disc set.TIP: I bought this disc set on Black Friday for around $35. I likely would not have pulled the trigger if it were the regular price. So if you are not in a big rush, I would wait for Amazon Prime day or a holiday sale to get it on a deal.

  An excellent collection the components of which must be judged n their individual merits. Frankly, I don't understand the Harry Potter phenomena but the movies made from the books are reasonable faithful without becoming 12-hour epics of each one. If you liked the books you'll probably like the movies. If you're a Potter purist, you might be disappointed.

  First of all, I’m a Harry Potter superfan. It took me a while to realize, but the DVD’s are like shortened versions that don’t have all of the scenes. There’s also like the rentable versions that don’t have any special features. As some of the reviews pointed out, some of the DVDs just look like burned copies. Very disappointing to find these things out.

Because we lay this case down horizontally instead of like a vertical book, it's okay, but just be aware.  The sound and picture quality are great.

  It's great to have the entire Harry Potter series in one complete collection.  However, when I compared the quality of the original special edition release of the first Harry Potter movie I found the audio and visual clarity of the 8-disc set edition to be inferior.  The sound was muted and less powerful and the visual display was dull and not as bright.  I don't know why this kind of thing happens or why the DVD manufacturers muck with the originals but it is definitely done.  Bummer.  The price is good for what you get.

  Several of the discs in this set are not readable. The either skip and freeze every few seconds, or won't load at all. Unfortunately, given the number of total discs in the set, it took me a while to get to the defective discs and so I'm stuck with them. I give 2 stars for the discs that actually worked. While there are a lot of extras, the vast majority are of the talking head, pre-movie promotional kind of crap, not anything really in depth behind the scenes. Overall, not too pleased...

Each disc comes separately packaged, and then all of the discs are gathered into one large cardboard (?) sleeve. While that has nothing to do with the quality of the item, it does matter to those of us with a concern for aesthetics, and the appeal that can be brought when purchasing an entire collection instead of purchasing each film separately.The films are an excellent buy, and definitely worth the purchase.

I realize this is a series that must be watched from start to finish and that folks who popped in to see one episode in the middle of the series were left feeling confused and, it seems, annoyed. I loved the books and, despite the violence in the later books and movies, I think this was a great series. If you haven't read the books, though, it might be a bit less understandable.  I don't know that from personal experience, but it is something someone has said .It's Sci-Fi-Fan in a delicious, magical format. Enjoy!

  So far I have watched 5 of the 8 disks. The fifth disk looked clearly like it was from another set on DVD's (different text font etc.) it also skipped and paused near the end of the movie but after rewinding it and playing it back again it didn't glitch. I am hoping the last 3 disks are in good condition because otherwise this is a great deal, only about $6.50 per movie. The disks are inconsistent though as some of them have previews while some go straight to the menu screen and some have special features while others do not. If you are just looking to own all of the movies and don't care about those things than this is a great purchase. If you want all complete DVD's with special features and consistency this might not be right for you.

  What's not to love?  I have lent out my Harry Potter movie collection over the years, and lost a fair few, so getting this set was wonderful.  I now have all of my favorite movies, along with great extras.  Get this for any true Harry Potter fan, they'll love you for it.

  Its great, I am actually watching it now. The only thing is that the inside part that holds the discs, one of them is broken and I have to be careful when I shut it as it sticks out a bit if I am not careful. The DVD's are fine though. All in good shape. Thank you.

  Awesome movies didn’t have any problems except for the fact that they were really dark, like I literally had to watch the movies at night to really see some of the scenes. It is understandable however, since the disk come all together, the are older movies for the most part, and it’s not in like HD. Just a little hard to see!

  Love Harry Potter!  I'm happy with this purchase.  The compact packaging works well for me.  I've watched all the movies from this box set and haven't had any problems with the discs skipping.The special feature menus on the discs are difficult for me to navigate. I'm not sure if this is because I'm using my Xbox One to play them on and the controller just doesn't want to work properly with the setup or if this is a problem other people have noticed. I also have a hard time seeing what option is highlighted in the special feature menu.I got this box set to have the movies to watch whenever I get the itch to revisit them.  Therefore the special feature problems don't bother me too much.  Definitely happy with this purchase.

My wife and I watched the full series in DVD for the first time a few weeks ago and loved them. They are really wonderful films. I decided to try the Blu-ray edition on my new player. They are really beautiful. The clarity and detail in these Blu-rays are amazing. I haven't watched them all yet, but I'm confident they will all have this great quality. I highly recommend this set.

  I love the small case that all 8 movies come in.  I already own all of the movies but I wanted them to be in one small case. I saw this on sale for under $30 and thought that it was great so I got it. One problem I had though was the fact that the little plastic piece in the case to keep the disc in place had already been broken before I removed the plastic off of the case. It is quite disappointing to buy something brand new and realize that it is already broken. Hopefully this won't be a big issue and ruin the disc. Other than that I am quite happy with my purchase.

  I bought this during Black Friday on a whim, even though the reviews were REALLY confusing. It appears Amazon has combined the Harry Potter Hogwarts collection review with the less expensive package (typically priced at about $50). I've seen both in person now, and there are substantial differences between the two in both packaging and content.Harry Potter Hogwarts Collection:This packaging is NOT cheap. It's a thick cardboard-like book (reminds me of my Game of Thrones packaging, but still even better than that) which slides out of an equally sturdy cardboard case. The book contains pages where the DVDs are slipped into (not quite as protective as the plastic prong thingies, but that's really the only complaint I have). This collection comes with the extended cuts (for those that had extended cuts) and the mother-load of special features. The enormous trunk that was released last year for around $350 (now priced around $650) is probably the closest equivalent as you aren't only getting the standard edition movies. If you're like me and have been to Universal Studios Orlando Wizarding World more than twice and made the trek (assuming you're American) across the pond to London for the WB Studio Tour, but can't quite stomach $300+ for DVDs, no matter how wonderful, then this is probably the set for you. For me, the biggest selling point was that it came with the digital versions of the movies. The fancy packaging was an added bonus.Harry Potter: 8-Film Collection:This is available in either blu-ray or dvd and definitely the most economical way to get all 8 movies in one package. As some other reviews have noted, it's pretty standard packaging for dvd/blu-ray sets. This set is truly all about economy of price AND space. If you like the movies, but aren't quite the enthusiastic HP fan, then I'd say you should be perfectly happy with this one. I don't believe there are any (or if there are, there are not MANY) special features with these. It's just the films - straight up as you saw them in theaters.

The words are not crisp and clear as they are in most films. We were so very disappointed! And every one of these is the same...we have a relatively new SONY TV, and we can hear other films perfectly, so we don't think the problem lies on this side.If you are thinking of purchasing this set, be aware that the same thing may happen to you.

  This collection is making dreams of mine come true. Beautifully packaged, packed with 31 discs. (All eight movies on blu-ray, the last two on 3D blu-ray, and the right DVDs as well as a dozen special features discs) A voucher for a digital copy of all eight films is also available, which is very cool to have.If one doesn't care to have all the bonus content, one of the other HP box sets would suffice. However, if you're a big Potter fan, this is definitely worth your money. I've loved (finally) watching all of the bonus features that I missed out on through the years.The feel of the set actually reminds me of the scrapbook Hagrid gave Harry at the end of the first movie, though I don't think that was intended. The material that the discs sit in is designed to be gentle on your discs when sliding them in and out of the case, which I had been concerned about pre-purchase. This set is definitely worth your money.

  This review refers to the Hogwarts Collection (31 DVD's, Blu Ray discs, and 3D Blu Ray discs in a long flat book with a photograph of an older Daniel Radcliffe surrounded by the Battle of Hogwarts in the back.We've been Potter-heads at home for a few years (though more the movies than the books so far).  For the moment, this is the definitive super-genius edition of the 8-film series.  The Blu Ray editions of the movies are all stunning and in good sound.  The first two movies offer the option of viewing the movie as an extended cut, with deleted scenes restored into the sequence of the film.For those who have been wondering, the ABC Family network acquired broadcast rights to the movies, and have offered all the movies with deleted scenes put back into the sequence.  Unfortunately, those extended cuts cannot be recreated on these Blu Ray discs.  You can see the deleted scenes separately, but not as a single continuity.  Which is a shame, because I've found those scenes do add all manner of shading and nuance to a story that gets more and more compactly told as Rowling's books got bigger and bigger.The extras are extraordinary.  A multi-hour documentary series called ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" broadcast on Bravo once or twice, and every episode is available in this set.  And on top of that, there are also other featurettes (some of which do also recycle similar interview and clip bits) and separate making of and extra DVD's.So for someone like me, who tends to get super-genius editions of my favorite movies, this was the only choice.  Until, of course, somebody issues the extended cuts (reminding me of a favorite line from ""Men in Black:"" ""Now I have to buy the White Album all over again."")

Also, it has a ton of special features that really dive into the movie making. The reason I rated 3 stars was due to the fact that the movie download code was expired. I reached out to the amazon seller and they were not helpful at all. After a lot of effort, I finally got the code to work by reaching out to the manufacturer. So, great product, poor customer service.

  If you want to buy all of Harry Potter's movies in a single package, and you don't care much for extra features, look no further. At less than $7.00 per Blu-ray, this set gives you great value for your money.I wasn't a fan of the Harry Potter saga when the movies first came out. In fact, it was not until the 3rd movie, Prisoner of Azkaban, that I decided to give in to the hype, and watch the first movie. I was hooked, maybe not to a hardcore level that would compel me to buy all the books and collector’s editions, but just enough to want to have all the movies in high definition.This collection has all 8 movies for $54.99 (at the time of writing). When you realize that you get all the movies for just under $7.00 each, the decision becomes fairly easy. The box is very compact for such a (big) collection. It has roughly the thickness of two regular sized single disc DVD/Blu-ray boxes put together.Do keep in mind that this collection includes the movie discs ONLY. You do not get any extra discs with any features, though the movie discs do have a few extra features here and there.Another thing to note is that not all the movies have the same languages. For example, the first movies (first four if I remember correctly) have 10 to 15 different language audio tracks available, but the rest have only English, Spanish, French and Portuguese (again, IF I remember correctly).It seems to me that these collections are some sort of clearance of individual film box sets. For the sake of making a point, suppose that each movie is first individually sold in box sets that include the movie disc, and an additional disc with special features. Now suppose that you take only the movie discs from all 8 individual box sets and put them all together in a single box set. This is what you are getting.The reason I think this might be the case, is that the last 3 movie discs have extra labels printed on them, which read either “Disc 1 Movie” or “The Movie”. These labels are usually printed on discs that are part of a box set that includes other discs with additional features, as a guide to tell them apart. I am including a photo so you can see what I mean.Do keep in mind that this does not at all affect the quality or experience of the movies. I just point it out because you might notice the lack of consistency in the printed labels of the discs.To wrap things up:PROS- Great value for money, at less than $7.00 per movie at the time of writing.- Consistent video and audio quality. Great image and great sound in all the movies.- Several extra features included in all the discs.- All 8 movies neatly stored in a compact case.CONS- There are no discs dedicated to extra features. Most people will probably not care about this, but if having a lot of extra features is important to you, then you might want to check out another collection.- The disc case feels cheap, especially the disc holders. They feel as if they would break easily.- Inconsistent language audio track selection. Not all movies contain the same amount of available language tracks.NEUTRAL- No extra artwork included.

",19,2-Jan-15,,p,"

  If you want to buy all of Harry Potter's movies in a single package, and you don't care much for extra features, look no further. At less than $7.00 per Blu-ray, this set gives you great value for your money.I wasn't a fan of the Harry Potter saga when the movies first came out. In fact, it was not until the 3rd movie, Prisoner of Azkaban, that I decided to give in to the hype, and watch the first movie. I was hooked, maybe not to a hardcore level that would compel me to buy all the books and collector’s editions, but just enough to want to have all the movies in high definition.This collection has all 8 movies for $54.99 (at the time of writing). When you realize that you get all the movies for just under $7.00 each, the decision becomes fairly easy. The box is very compact for such a (big) collection. It has roughly the thickness of two regular sized single disc DVD/Blu-ray boxes put together.Do keep in mind that this collection includes the movie discs ONLY. You do not get any extra discs with any features, though the movie discs do have a few extra features here and there.Another thing to note is that not all the movies have the same languages. For example, the first movies (first four if I remember correctly) have 10 to 15 different language audio tracks available, but the rest have only English, Spanish, French and Portuguese (again, IF I remember correctly).It seems to me that these collections are some sort of clearance of individual film box sets. For the sake of making a point, suppose that each movie is first individually sold in box sets that include the movie disc, and an additional disc with special features. Now suppose that you take only the movie discs from all 8 individual box sets and put them all together in a single box set. This is what you are getting.The reason I think this might be the case, is that the last 3 movie discs have extra labels printed on them, which read either “Disc 1 Movie” or “The Movie”. These labels are usually printed on discs that are part of a box set that includes other discs with additional features, as a guide to tell them apart. I am including a photo so you can see what I mean.Do keep in mind that this does not at all affect the quality or experience of the movies. I just point it out because you might notice the lack of consistency in the printed labels of the discs.To wrap things up:PROS- Great value for money, at less than $7.00 per movie at the time of writing.- Consistent video and audio quality. Great image and great sound in all the movies.- Several extra features included in all the discs.- All 8 movies neatly stored in a compact case.CONS- There are no discs dedicated to extra features. Most people will probably not care about this, but if having a lot of extra features is important to you, then you might want to check out another collection.- The disc case feels cheap, especially the disc holders. They feel as if they would break easily.- Inconsistent language audio track selection. Not all movies contain the same amount of available language tracks.NEUTRAL- No extra artwork included.

  For those of you not really into ""collector"" items or special features or the like this is for you. Just the movies and no BS. I've seen a few people complaining about their discs being messed up or different and all I have to say is that is unusual and probably just a glitch in the printing for the discs or something. All eight of my movies were printed and etched correctly, all are widescreen, and all play just fine.Definitely worth the money and I would recommend you pick one up straight away if you love the HP series.

  Not sure what everyone is complaining about.  They are talking about it not being a collectors edition or fancy packaging. It is exactly what I wanted.  If you love The Harry Potter movies and are looking for the collection on blu ray that you can pop in the disk player and watch when you want, then this is it.  They were packaged in a disc holder that takes up about as much room as 2 average blu ray disks clamshell side-by-side.  I don't write a lot of reviews on my purchases, but this was perfect.  PLUS I got it for 43.00 on the deal of the day on my amazon app!!!!

  It came nicely packaged, included all 8 films in one unit, a lot of the box sets are using regular DVD cases I like the one they used for this box set. The quality was very good for DVDs although there is a blueray version of this available too if you want very high quality.I'm not supposed to rate the film but if I was I would be taking a star away. This was the first time I had seen the ending and was very disappointed. It felt rushed and not well made. But because I'm not rating the actual video on the disks I still give it 5 stars.

The rest of the collection was ok, but I noticed that some scenes were deleted on the movies. I love the Harry Potter movies as much as the books, but the company definitely did not care about the qualityof the product they are putting out, knowing that people will still buy them. I also bought the bluray set, but have not had the chance to view it. I hope it is much better than the dvd set.

  It's a good set. The blu ray quality is top notch. Basically they just took the feature film blu ray from the individual sets and put them in this collection. If you just want the movies in blu ray, and are not obsessed with special/extra features, then this is a good choice. Amazon often puts this set on deal (especially around the holidays. I picked it up on deal for $34.99) so I'd wait for it to be on deal and then snatch it up.

  The only thing I didn't really appreciate about these dvds was that they would play automatically if the main menu was left on for too long without any use. So if say, you pop in the dvd and step out of the room for a few minutes, when you return, the movie will be playing.Also be aware that the third disc comes with a preview for The Polar Express that could make you think that you received an incorrectly programmed dvd, but going to the main disc menu will clear up any confusion.

  It took a little while to buy this set because my wife already had all of the movies on dvd but we finally made the transition after she had a couple dvd copies die on us. I love that we now have them all in one set on blu-ray.

  Okay this is set is amazing....  these books are amazing, the movies are amazing...J.K. Rowling is a bada$$.  I literally have nothing negative to say about this purchase.  And I have no shame admitting that since I have purchased this set (2 years ago) I *may or may not* have re-watched this around 30 times...  These movies are THAT good.

  Low rating due to destroyed case. Our kiddos love these movies and just opened them up for Christmas. Unfortunately the plastic case was completely destroyed. It was not noticeable until we took the plastic off of the cardboard box that the plastic case slides into. Luckily the DVDs are in good shape, but we now have no way of storing them.

  I was disappointed to find that the DVD's contained scratches, and the DVD case itself was broken when I unwrapped and opened the DVD set. While I do believe that there should not be any technical issues, it is a always a possibility when a disc has a scratch of any kind. I was under the impression that I was going to receive brand new DVD's and what I found was unsatisfactory. My review is strictly based on the initial presentation of the product itself.

  This set was absolutely fantastic! I watched all eight movies this past weekend and they all played wonderfully.  The video was clear, even in dark scenes and the audio was outstanding.  The case that the DVDs came in was the perfect size to keep on a shelf.  Mind you, this review is not for the Bluray format,  this is for the DVD format.  No skips or any other problems.  Also, bear in mind that this set is also not a collector's item.  This is a bare bones set, it doesn't include any bonus content so if you want that, look elsewhere.  This includes all eight theatrical versions of the movies, that's all.  Again, outstanding quality.  I'm very pleased with this product.

  Amazing deal for the price. The blu-ray collection has all the movies and is a pretty compact size. Even though a lot of the movies come on TV a lot, this collection is highly recommended, since by all accounts this is one of the best fantasy series of all time. I thought it looked childish and always avoided watching them as an adult, but finally I broke down and watched them all, and they blew me away. I'm now a huge fan and in the process of reading the books.

  Ths review is for the Blu Ray version of the complete 8 disc set.I will be brief and to the point.Extended Scenes - Yes. (Compared to the standard DVD collector's 1-5 set)Bonus Material - Yes. Each disc has bonus material.In fact, all the bonus material is labeled right on the back cover of the set box.Other reviews stated there were none or just the last 2 discs has some.But the truth is, all of the discs have bonus material.I think some reviewers tried to pull a ""stupify!"" on us.If the rumours are true that there will be no more sets released after the New Yearthen you had better hurry and get this set now.When compared to the standard DVD Years 1-5 collector set I am very happywith the quality upgrade the Blu Ray discs offer along with extended scenes I have never seen before.So get on your Nimbus 2000 and grab a copy of this set before its gone forever.(except on eBay for over bloated prices).

  My family and I greatly enjoyed this series.  Being based on a book series, the movies were very detail oriented.  You really had to pay attention. Subtitles are a must.  The FX were really good too.  It was also kind of neat watching how the characters grew up on screen, as the movies were released over a 10 year period.

  The disks were completely fine and plan on watching the movies here shortly. Just wanted to point out a pet peeve and one that is strong for myself. The case came damaged and missing a piece. Toward the top along the spine of the case, it could easily become further damaged from normal use and will now need to find a replacement so added cost. I do know this will not happen most of the time, but it is something that can happen and completely sucks when it does. Had it not or if I could get a replacement for it would have easily pulled a 5 star rating.

  For those who simply want the base DVD collection, this is a fairly good buy. I bought for the holiday sale price, but even $40 isn't too terribly steep considering it breaks down to $5/disc.The size of the case is very convenient being only the width of about two standard DVD cases.The disks are simple (just the labeling, no graphics) but that doesn't take away from functionality obviously.The case isn't extremely durable. As long as you handle it the way one should then there will be no problems with a broken case.In short, it's a great buy for simplicity's sake and for those who don't have an abundance of shelf-space.

  I just wanted all the movies in 1 set and this box set works for me.  Not sure why anyone would buy other sets before all the movies were released.  I know Warner Brothers is releasing other versions/sets with extra extras but I could care less about all that.  I just wanted the movies together and that's what this is.  With that being said, anyone looking for all the movies together in a nice compact set, this should work for you.  My only complaint is I saw this same set for 50% less at Walmart last Christmas but I wasn't waiting until then.

  I honestly did not expect much given all the reviews that the product was sub-par with mismatched discs that only sometimes worked. I can tell you all of these reviews must really be outdated because my product was much better than described.The case was a decently sturdy plastic case which inserts into a cardboard sleeve. All 8 discs worked beautifully. They were all the widescreen versions and all had the proper artwork on the discs (no blank covers or 'disc1' flubs).5 stars given based on price. Are there bonus material discs? No. Are there other quality of life improvements that could be had? Yes. But this set gives you all movies for alittle over $3 a movie at the time of this writing and at that price range I cannot ask for more.

  I have all the original dvds before the the Blu-Ray players became popular. This is a bare bones set for the movies which was exactly what I was looking for and expected based on the Black Friday price of only $27.00. It replaced my full screen (for movies 1-3) with a full HD wide screen collection. I would recommend this for anyone who just wants to get the High res version of the movies and doesn't want to break the bank in doing so.  Also this set is a great space saver as it comes in 1 booklet style case.

  It's great to have such an economical choice to get all the movies in one box, but I found that each disc tends to freeze at times in various places (it will freeze one time playing on one track.  Another playing it freezes on another track).  And once it freezes everything is frozen.  I had to eject the disc and reload to get it playing again.  Sometimes they freeze multiple times.  Sigh.  Otherwise the quality is good.  I would have loved some features that meant something as well.

I'm not a big fan of how you have to get the discs out, which is the only reason I am taking off a star. You have to sort of push the disk from behind, and it just feels too rough. Maybe that's just me.This is great for any Harry Potter fan. I would never spend the money on that larger collection...this comes with everything you need and more.One note, my Blu-ray of the first movie is unwatchable. It has a large scratch that skips about 2 or three chapters. I tried cleaning it to no avail. I am not letting that affect my rating, but I do need a replacement on that if possible. I will be contacting asap.

  Here's the down low. December 29th All the Harry Potters are going into the Warner vault (no vault is not a Disney coined term) That means for about 2-5+ years they will print no more new Harry Potter DVDs. For probably about a year or so the warehouses will continue to ship what they have to stores like, Best Buy, Target, Walmart and stores like Movie Trading Company. Gradually the dwindling of supplies will cause the bigger stores to stop ordering them and only stores like mine will carry them until the warehouse runs out and then we run out and for once the Harry Potter movies become rare. Prices will skyrocket because it's a popular series.Now, 5+ years later they release an awesome SUPER special addition that will cost a billion dollars and have all the bells and whistles.If you're looking for all the movies by themselves to tide you over until the Super special edition, this is it. It's small and compact and comes with language options (something I didn't expect). So if you're a fan, go ahead and by it and wait for the awesome. Of course they won't release the special editions right away, that's bad business....

  This is a great box set. They get rid of the senseless papers and 8 different blu-ray cases to give you an easy-to-access, bare essential package. The first 5 movies are presented without a menu (hence the 4-star rating). Menus are one of my favorite things about Blu-Ray and DVD's, so having the movie automatically start was kind of lame. Even worse when I noticed the ""Menu"" text is barely readable and the awful yellow color hurts my eyes when watching on my smaller TV.Movies 6, 7, and 8 have menus. The special features for all three of the final films are quite lackluster in comparison to what was offered with 1-5.1-5 Special Features consist of interviews with cast and crew, behind the scenes shots, cool interviews and character profiles.6-8 Special Features consist of watching the movie with ""Maximum Viewing Mode"" or something. It basically plays the movie in the background and instead of commentary, you see actual actors, producers, directors etc. talking about the film. It's okay, but not as interesting as straight commentary would have been.For what it's worth, the collection is great. The movies look crisp and visually pleasing when viewing on my 52"" Plasma TV. The sound for the films is great, except for the last 2 films which tend to have louder action scenes and quieter dialogue. If you're a fan of Harry Potter this is the set to have.

  This is a great box set. They get rid of the senseless papers and 8 different blu-ray cases to give you an easy-to-access, bare essential package. The first 5 movies are presented without a menu (hence the 4-star rating). Menus are one of my favorite things about Blu-Ray and DVD's, so having the movie automatically start was kind of lame. Even worse when I noticed the ""Menu"" text is barely readable and the awful yellow color hurts my eyes when watching on my smaller TV.Movies 6, 7, and 8 have menus.

Well, needless to say, after watching the first one, I immediately ordered these Blu-Ray DVD's.  I am now on DVD 5 and plan to watch them again since there is so much to absorb.  They are truly amazing!  I paid a tad bit extra other than prime to receive them quickly which they came even before promised!!!

  It's a bootleg DVD series. Watched the first two movies and there was no menu screen and it wasn't the best quality but given the price I was not shocked. Then we tried to watch Prisoner of Azkaban and it was the Polar Express. The DVD face read ""Harry Potter Prisoner of Azkaban"" but it was a low quality, VERY pixelated Polar Express. I would not recommend buying.

  Bought this set last spring and have NEVER been able to get the last three movies in the set to play. They either don't go at all or just stop during the film and freeze up the machine. Of course by the time I got around to playing them and made it all the way to the end of the series, it was too late to return them all. Luckily I had the last three movies on regular DVD so I was able to keep continuity in viewing all the films in preparation for visiting the ""World of Harry Potter"" in London.

  I love Harry Potter and have always wanted to buy the movies however I wanted to wait until I could buy them as a set. Until that time I had just been watching them when on occasion they came on tv. I waited until all the movies had come out and then in January I bought this set. I started watching them and immediately noticed something was off. Not even halfway through the first movie I noticed some scenes had been cut/edited out of these movies. For example, in the first movie before Harry gets his first letter from Hogwarts the scene where Dudley is trying on his new school uniform had been completely taken out. I am a little disappointed that I paid for these movies not knowing that...

Theres a scene probably in the first 15-20 mins where the video and audio skip and jump. We took the disc out, checked our blu-ray, which never has issues tried it again, and it did the same thing in the same spot. We had to ffwd to a point where it wasn't doing it so we missed a part of the movie and story.

  First off great collection.  All the bonus features are great.  Do you have a 3D player?  If not consider getting a 3D converter box and 3D Blu-Ray player.  Both for about $100.  I haven't done this yet but will after month beginning and update then.  Reason movies 7 & 8 have a 3D version on top of DVD and Blu-Ray.  I purchased this when it was an Amazon special and got a great price for it so I won't compare US vs UK and only talk about this packageOkay, now that you heard that lets get in more details.  As stated there are 31 disks a regular blu-ray, regular DVD, Ultraviolet and as well as a special 3D of each movie 7 & 8.  The bonus features most I had seen but a lot I hadn't.  Little tidbits like how they choose Richard Harris as Dumbledore. Did you know there is a godchild/godfather relation between Harris and the producer?  I don't recall seeing that in any other behind the scenes to which there are hours and hours of material.I loved that the first two movies you got to see the theater release or the extended/ABC Family version.  I always prefer extended or director cuts even if they slow the movie for a moment or two.  I would have liked to have seen the deleted scenes restored and an extended version of all the rest of the movies made available in this set.  This is my first of only two digs I have with this set.  The second is the packaging.  Although they make it appear like a travel photo album the packaging is cardboard sleeves holding three or four disks per movie per page.  The graphics are nice but I prefer a more traditional pop release feature for my DVDs.Unless they come out with extended versions of all 8 movies I suggest getting this for any Potter fan.

The only extended editions are year 1 and 2 though on blu ray. Also the extra disk which is exlusive to this set is also only on blu ray. I just love that it also has those classic dvd games that were included on the first releases of harry potter movies. They don't put the mini games on the dvds anymore these days so it was nice to see that again here.The ultraviolet digital code YES STILL WORKS.To redeem go to the OFFICAL ultraviolet site, once you put it your code it will re-direct you to vudu were you can log in and just like magic, it's been added to your vudu account! If you threw away the code because you were dumb enough to go to vudu directly, thats your problem not mine.

  I have enjoyed the Harry Potter franchise for years, and it is nice to finally own the hole series. It did surprise me that they didn't make new disks, they just took the moves from the individual releases. This is obvious in the fact that not all the disks have the same style, and that the sixth disk says ""DISK 1 MOVIE"", and the 7ht, and 8th saying ""THE MOVIE"", and while this is not a huge thing for me, I know some people prefer to have a matching set when they buy a complete collection. Overall I am happy I purchased this, and I am sure I will get hours upon hours of entertainment. If you didn't grow up with Harry Potter, I don't think you will enjoy the early films, and if you don't enjoy the early films, you probably wouldn't like the later films where you start to get the real payoffs, and action scenes.

  The Harry Potter complete 8 Film Collection truly is awesome.  The DVD's itself come in one package that hold all 8 films, almost like a book.  The individual films have the same look as the original film covers.  The first 5 or so have no previous, which is nice and the special features on the DVD's are the ones that are on the original DVD's as well.  There areno extra DVD with special features included, which is totally fine with us.  There are rumors that another collection will come out with more special features, but we can only recommend this product!You will definitely enjoy it.

  The Harry Potter complete 8 Film Collection truly is awesome.  The DVD's itself come in one package that hold all 8 films, almost like a book.  The individual films have the same look as the original film covers.  The first 5 or so have no previous, which is nice and the special features on the DVD's are the ones that are on the original DVD's as well.  There areno extra DVD with special features included, which is totally fine with us.

  I was initially concerned these were maybe bootleg DVDs based on some of the reviews but now that I've seen them I can safely say they are professionally made and the video quality is spectacular.

  I love the Harry Potter films and haven't purchased any of the movies, so this was a great way to get every movie in a compact box set as an Xmas present to myself for an unbelievable low price $39. The complete film set has 8 DVDs in its individual DVD digi-tray but not in individual jewel cases which makes it compact, slim, and easy to store. This complete collection even has ""The Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" which I have not seen yet. Great product, great price, and complete set. I would highly recommend this film collection.

  This is exactly what I needed. My girlfriend had never seen any of these movies before (crazy, right?), so I wanted the cheapest, most basic set I could find for us to marathon through. It comes in a mega sized single case that contains all 8 discs, which I actually love because I hate sets that come with several ""skinny"" cases. All of these are mostly just reprints of previous issues (you can tell since some of the films have a ""Disc One"" labeled on them), but they're pretty nice. Popping the disc in brings you straight to the movie... no fiddling for the remote to start the movie, no annoying trailers for 5+ year old movies to sit through, and no obnoxious menus with 10 second audio loops. Just the movie followed by a silent menu afterwards... it's perfect.The actual quality of these blu ray transfers are just above average. Excellent at times, mediocre/poor in a few others. You can see some artifacts here and there, and the dark scenes can seem a bit grainy at times, but overall it's pretty good for the most part.One other thing - as others have pointed out, the discs DO come with special features. Not many, mostly just deleted/alternate scenes, but plenty enough for casual fans of the series. I recommend the more hardcore fans go with the more expensive set, or even the UK version.Overall - highly recommended if you're looking to get a somewhat cheap Harry Potter experience. I picked this up for $55 on Amazon, so that makes each movie a little less than $7 a pop. Considering how great the movies consistently are, that's a steal. If you don't mind the set skimping out on some featurettes and making-ofs and other extra features the individual deluxe copies had, this set is a no-brainer for Harry Potter fans.

  I've been debating about this one for a while and ordered when the price finally dropped to what I wanted to pay.  I really only wanted the movies and having a couple of extras like deleted scenes suits me just fine.  Got the package a few days later and it was in a bubble-wrapped envelope vs. the amazon box I expected.  Thought... no biggie, as long as it's what I ordered. Opened it up and the holders were broken in places. You could hear them scraping up against the discs and the slightest pressure mad the box feel like it was going to crumble any second.I've never had to retunr anything to amazon, so I dreaded the ordeal, but this just wasn't what I paid for.  So I went online and found out I coudln't get it replaced because it was supplied by someone else apparently.  I had to get a refund, wait for that to be processsed, then reorder the set.  By then the price had gone up by like 25%.  However, Amazon's Support Team rocks and they gave me the same price as I ordered it before without a fuss and fixed everything within minutes of me placing the order.Everything was resolved quickly and I received the new set the next day and this one was delivered in the amazon box. Open it up and this is where it got strange... This box set was completely different than the first one I received.  The first one had four holders, each holding 2 discs, in a larger sleeve and all were cheaply made, thus the breakage during delivery I'm assuming.  The new one looks like the pictures on amazon.com.  It's a slim box with one holder that slides out and opens up like a book.  You turn the pages to see all the dics.  Much better quality than the first one and very happy with the purchase now that it's all fixed.Lesson in all this... make sure when you purchase it says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon"".  This changes from day to day it seems.

I own digital versions of all (Amazon) but needed something I could toss into a standard DVD player for the road.  The most incredible series that kept fans going to the theaters every time a new version came out.  I rate this with Lords of the Rings, and now the Hobbit Series, even better in fact but still worthy of purchasing in book, digital, and DVD and Blu-Ray formats.

  I don't usually write product reviews, but I really feel the need to do this, since the existing reviews are conflicting:I tip-toed around buying the 8-film Harry Potter Collection for a while.  A bunch of the reviews mentioned things like sub-par discs, discs with the wrong cover art (or no cover art), etc.  I finally decided to go for it; I could always return it if it wasn't up to my standards.The set arrived and it's exactly what I was hoping for.  It has all eight movies, with all the correct art and the expected, single-case packaging.  In response to the images included at the top of the page from the customer who had the black disc for the 7th movie, etc - all I can assume is that there was an incorrect batch out there somewhere, and this has since been corrected.If you're looking for tons of extras and super-fan material, then perhaps this isn't the set for you (although it seems the only other alternative is ridiculously expensive).  However, all I wanted was a set of all eight movies for a reasonable price, and this did that for me.  I highly recommend.

  I really love this set of the whole Harry Potter series. Its relatively cheap and of pretty nice quality. Though it has next to no special features, this is basically a set for lovers of the movies ONLY! For me the only format of the movies I received was widescreen so no complaints from me. That was one of the concerns of mine, but I was pleasantly surprised! I would probably buy again, not for the lack of special features but for the movies themselves.

  this is not a movie review but a review of the dvd quality. this is a great value if you just want all the movies and dont care if the picture is very good quality. the picture is quite noisy especially in dark scenes. on a big tv with clear picture it would probably be more noticeable but its adequate for viewing on a laptop or an older tv with lower definition.

  I love the HP series and I'm glad I have them all on Blu-ray now. I also got a great deal on the set. However, mine did come in a broken case. It isn't too big of an issue, but disappointing. Again, it was on sale, so I didn't go through the hassle of replacing it.

  This blu-ray set is an 8 film collection of an iconic series. I love all the movies!!! If you want to binge watch and own all 8, this is for you! If you're a collector, I would advise to stray from this edition as it comes in one blu-ray case and not separate cases for each movie. Other than that, each blu-ray is the standard edition of each respective movie. A must have for the casual potter fan!

  Our son gave us a beautiful and nice HDTV for Christmas.  Huge surprise!!! especially since we all agreed to not have a gift exchange for the adults in our family this year.  We did not see the ending of the Harry Potter series as yet and we wanted to begin our new adventure into Blu ray with movies that we were sure would be really good and that would demonstrate the effects of having Blu ray technology.  We already have seen several of the Harry Potter movies at the movie theater, and have the first six Harry Potter movies at home on regular DVD.  Having watched them several times, and expecting to purchase the remaining ones anyway...for about $40-$50, it seemed appropriate to choose the Blu ray version and get the whole series at once.  To continue with the technology of this 21st century, we bought a nice Panasonic Blu ray player and will get some Logitech speakers with a sub-woofer in the next few weeks to enhance the sound. We are really looking forward to it!  The price of the Harry Potter: The Complete 8 Film Collection (Blu ray) was good and a deciding factor to go this route. The cost of getting the last 2 movies would have been approximately $50 anyway, so spending a little more to purchase this set was a good choice for us.  The set contains only the movies (without the extra discs that we don't really use at all anyway).  The container is nice and has clear blue plastic book-like pages which are practical for holding the discs securely and all in one place. The jacket is nice for protecting the ""book"". The quality of the movies speak for themselves, and we are very happy with our purchase of this Blu ray collection. Just another note....it arrived in a short time and in perfect condition.  Very happy with every one of our Amazon experiences.  Signed: Dolores Jones

  For years my family has read the books and watched the movies while I have shunned the series altogether.  I finally decided to purchase the box set and while yes, it doesn't seem to have a bunch of special features it does have all the movies which is what I cared about anyway as I am not a Harry Potter fanboy.  My boyfriend and I watched it over a 6 week period and we actually really enjoyed the films.  I'm thinking about having another Harry Potter weekend when the next 3 day weekend rolls around.

  The quality of the product was there, but not the content.  I noticed in more than one of the movies that there were scenes missing.  Nothing crucial to the story, but scenes that I see on TV airings of the movies.  And those airings usually cut things out.  When I am paying for a movie, I expect to get the entire movie.

  I am a HUGE HP fan, but have never bought any of the movies. When I first saw this set online, I was so excited! After reading some of the negative reviews, I decided to take my chances and get it, and I am so glad that I did! It came in a couple days (with Amazon Prime), and the price was fantastic! $40 for 8 DVDs... how can you complain? Within a week I had watched all eight movies and encountered zero problems with this collection. Each disc was in the box with its corresponding movie poster image on the disc. The menus are not simply still images, they are moving menus with music. The movies all played perfectly fine. As for what people have said about special features or lack thereof... that part doesn't really matter to me. There are a few, which I haven't checked out yet, but remember, many of the ""behind-the-scenes"" and interviews with the cast are available for free on YouTube! The movies in their entirety are not, and I bought this set purely for the movies. If you ARE, however, looking for a ton of bonus features, then spend a lot more money on a different collection. If, like me, you just want to have the movies to watch (over and over... and over), then this set is a GREAT deal and one of the best purchases I have made. I would highly recommend it.

  I'm not so young anymore, but guess there is a bit of the child still in me as I love the ""Harry Potter"" series. Though the stations rerun some of the movies, I'd never seen ""The Deathly Hallows"" and it was a perfect ending to a marvelous series. It is the kind that one watches more than once and each time sees or hears something you haven't heard or seen before. Just great for little kids and us big ones, too.

  I had passed up another less expensive 8-disc boxed set (the UK version) because the title of the first film was ""The Philosopher's Stone"" (as opposed to the US version ""Sorcerer's Stone""). So I paid slightly more since this description stated ""The Sorcerer's Stone"". Then when it showed up at my door, it was the UK version instead of the US version.I know it's a small thing, and the films work great and all that, but it was the single selling point why I went with this set versus another, and then it turned out to be inaccurate.

  Awesome set on a discounted deal for Cyber Monday (~$90)! Includes all of the discs and features that are available today in one set for a cheap price. Does it have all of the collectible trinkets? No, just a well packaged set with all of the digital features a HP fan could want. Only thing that would make it better is if WB finally decided to release all extended edition movies instead of just the first two but until then, get this set if you want all of the features, no over priced ""collectibles"", for a reasonable price.

  Everything was fantastic HD quality. I noticed the ""Half Blood Prince"" Blue-Ray disk appeared rushed. Its the only disk that says ""Disk 1"" as though they just took a disk off the Collectors edition and inserted it into the collection.Its a great holiday treat to watch all the movies in progression. The actors grow and even though Ive seen it all several times before. Watching them all in the same week does make a huge difference in the overall story enjoyment.

  I saw what a good deal this was and have always wanted the box set, so I went ahead and ordered. When I opened the box you could see the poor production quality that gives rise to the discount price. The images on the DVDs were poorly printed on the disks with inconsistent locations from one disk to another. When I went to play the movies, the Prisoner of Azkaban disk played the Polar Express! I immediately returned the item for a replacement, and when the replacement arrived IT HAD THE SAME PROBLEM. It is amazing that such a defect would be so pervasive in this product. I have requested a refund and will have to continue to look elsewhere for a good box set.

  I had high hopes when I purchased this.  But all eight movies on 4K froze at some point during the movie.  I had to re-watch the movie on Blu-Ray because of the defective 4k.  Not at all pleased with this product.  2 and 1/2 stars (thanks to the blu-rays working).

  The case is beautiful but the images on the discs look like someone printed them from a computer.The disc holder inside the case broke as soon as I opened I and now it doesn't close.A couple of the discs are clearly not meant to be in the set but are replacements. The images on them aren't the same style as other discs in the case.So far the first disc works.

  Most blu ray movies run between 20 mbps to over 30 mbps. Regular dvds run about 5 mbps. These run between 5 mbps and 20 mbps, and average about 10 mbps. There quality is at the lowest end of the spectrum. These are from England. For instance instead  of  The Sorcerer's Stone, Its The Philosopher's stone. Even the script is different. I think that the quality specs in England are far less than here in the U.S. If you can make sure it's the U.S. version get, it if not don't.

  Finally got around to purchasing the whole set of Harry Potter movies - this was a great replacement for our old collection, some video, some DVD, and some missing from the set. We love these movies, and it was great to find a nice compact boxset so my younger child can enjoy these as he grows up, along with the older members of the family who are familiar with the series. What's not to love - all the movies in one set - it is convenient, and also helps cut down the clutter of movies in my home.

  I will write my review on the quality of the blu-rays and not the movies. If you're buying this box set you already know how you feel about them. I was extremely happy with the quality of the HD transfer to blu-ray, and the content in this box set though. Especially for the price. All the movies look amazing on disc. The first movie is the only one that really stands out as it has a bit more noticeable film grain to the image than the others. I actually enjoyed it though, as I thought it gave the image a bit more life. Overall, just a really high quality collection of blu-rays, but I wouldn't expect anything less.

  The Blu-rays that were included in this collection have a variety of appearances: some color, some black and white.  I point that out to suggest that these were not printed specifically for being a set.  It's as if they took extras from other printings and assembled them into this set.  The extras are also the extras that came with each movie, I don't believe there's anything additional.  So yes, this is a collection of the movies, but don't expect to be blown away by the presentation of them.That being said, the movies themselves are of course great.

Meaning it seems like they just pieced together a box set, and didn't make the 8 discs exclusively for this set. If that matters to you, it didn't matter to me. I love it. We do Harry Potter marathons now and then and it fit our needs just right. I am not going to give it a five star rating because of the mismatched discs.

  This has everything you could need if you want your Harry Potter films in high quality. The packaging is very simple to keep it from taking up too much shelf space. It's just a flipbook kind of design with nothing fancy to it. This comes with just the blu-rays and none of the extra content. I found this on sale and bought it immediately, it's too good to pass up.

  The only thing consistent throughout all 8 discs, is that they actually play. Other than that, they all look different. As if the collection was put together by using discs from other collections. The Chamber of Secrets is the only disc that features the movie cover, while the rest are a generic silver.  I prefer consistency but for the price I'll accept it.

  No frills here. A complete Blu-Ray set with limited extras in a compact case. I personally don't ever watch extras, so for me this is no big deal. The box seems a little flimsy as if the part that holds the DVD might break off. It's a cheaply made box set, by no means a collector's edition. But if you are looking for something that's okay for the kids to open and close a billion times this is a great option.

  If you like HP movies, you will like these. If you are a HARD CORE Potter fan, THIS IS NOT THE SET FOR YOU. Wait for the ultimate set that will be released soon. But if you are like me and just like the story and the magic, then this is the one. The High Definition quality gets better around the 4th disk. Over all, it's a nice set. The casing is very fragile, be careful letting kids handle it.I have to complain about the way it was shipped to me. The box was opened and I feared the set was not there. It also was not protected with anything, no bubble wrap, paper, nothing! It was moving around in the box. The set itself was sealed and didn't look like anyone had tried to open it. When I opened it, it was just fine. I just think Amazon personnel need to be careful.

  These movies look and sound great on Blu-Ray, and this is a nice basic pack of all 8 movies. As has been noted, it is a bit cheesy but the discs for each movie appear to be from other packagings of that movie (I.e. labeled 'disc 1' on a few of them, etc). They could have at least printed different disc labels.They also don't include any extra feature, not a problem for us, but some people might miss them.

Some have a DVD menu at the beginning and some do not, and one DVD does not really look like it's part of the set, but as if it was taken from a stand-alone movie and put in with the set.  I guess one of the reasons you buy things in sets is so that the discs are in a uniform format...

  I love this collection!  Not only is it nicely packaged (though I do find myself wishing it were not in contact with the page of the holder sometimes, just to assist with disc integrity over time), but I love all the extras. I'm a huge fan of knowing things from behind the scenes and what went into the movies, so all the bonus features were what made me want this.

  I won't be reviewing the movies but instead Ill be review this 'Collection' box. The audio quality and video quality of the films are top notch and as you would expect from a BluRay film. The disks all come in a double wide 8 Disk case and has a card board slip cover. The cardboard slip cover is very well made, sturdy and has a foil effect thats pleasing to look at. The disk case is also well made, doesn't feel cheap and should last a lifetime. I was disappointed by the disks themselves. The disks were clearly just reused from the standalone titles so they don't feature a unified theme generally found in boxed collections. Some of the disks even say Disk 1 or Disk 2 further showing that the disks were just reused from the stand alone set. I was really disappointed WB didn't take the time to reprint the disks for this collection and it makes the collection feel they didn't take the the and pushed it out the door.

Harry Potter is another great bit of Fantasy that a person can ""immerse"" himself in. I can imagine myself in Snapes' roll, or Harrys', or Hermiones'. I'll have a Harry Marathon one day soon. I hope ""The Gang"" is all doing well. Merry Christmas! It's good to see the youngsters grow into prosperous young adults. Especially Emma.

  These movies, while not as good as the books, are still great. The big bonus to this set is the size. All eight movies are packages in a case just slightly wider than two regular Blu-Ray cases. Fantastic for someone that doesn't have a huge amount of space to store movies, games, and cd's. There aren't as many special features as you often find in sets like this, but there are enough. There are very few movies and shows that I really have any interest in watching hours and hours of bonus material about, anyway. Anyone looking for a nice collector's set might want to look at other options.

These are movies in my opinion that draw in both adults as well as children a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. The Harry Potter 8 film collection is one of these types of movies good for the whole family. I recommend it for the whole family.

Watching this on a 54"" plasma in a dark room with a great sound system makes you believe you're at the movie theater, without all the hassle. My cat even noticed the multitude of birds in the 3rd movie, along with the footsteps on the map! Well worth the price. I feel the movies represent the books very well so far.

  Would like money back, but don't think it's possible. I bought this set on Black Friday on sale. Reviews all seemed to be great. When the set arrived, it arrived with no packing slip/receipt/anything in the box at all except for the movies. The cover and ALL of the movies appeared run-down and used. None of the films seemed to be from the same collection - some were blank, some had pictures on it, etc. I haven't tried all of the DVDs yet to see if they work, but the first one (Sorcerer's Stone) was so badly scratched it made a terrible noise in my DVD player and was immediately ejected, unable to play. Maybe I'm missing something, but this didn't say it was used from what I could tell. Since there was no slip, I don't think this can be returned - waste of money.

  A lot of negative reviews, I assume due to problems that have been rectified. First, I checked Disc 3 to make sure it was the correct Potter movie and not Polar express, as some customers received. Correct. Than watched the first installment in its entirety. I ordered the Blu-Ray version. It was sharp, with good color, and the sound was magnificent (particularly John Williams' score).I'm not doubting that some reviewers had problems, but I believe they've been fixed. My discs had full color, illustrated labels. Some people complained of graininess, bad sound, and flutter/inability to play. They said they received a black label with only the name of the movie.I'm a Florida resident and have a season  pass to Universal Studios thee park (and Disney).....I just wanted to familiarize myself so that the Harry Potter attractions made sense. At any rate, I enjoyed the first flick and look forward to seeing them all.

  I bought this as the Amazon deal of the day and got a great deal on it! Typically I like for each disc to be in a separate case and don't like for movie collections to all be in the same case (the cases often break easily and the plastic piece to which the disc affixes just kind of floats around inside the main case. This hasn't happened yet for my HP collection...maybe it's magic.I found it odd that the first disc went straight to the movie instead of to a menu screen. I like to put the movie in and then go do something while it goes through previews and whatnot (get some popcorn, make a cozy pillow/blanket fort) and then come back to the menu screen. I came back to this and it was 20 minutes in to the movie! I haven't seen the others from this collection yet, so I'm not sure if they'll do the same. I am rereading all of the books and then re-watching the movies directly after. Hoping that there is a menu screen on the other movies, but I guess we will find out.

  As a huge Harry Potter fan, I like this collection because I got it for a really good price. I used to have all the individual movies on DVD, but they were all stolen when we had a break-in. I wanted to replace them but not spend a fortune on all the individual movies again. This did the trick. It is not fancy, they do not come in their own little movie sleeves on anything. If you are looking for the movies but not for the frills, this is a good buy!

  Sure most of you have never heard of this little move series before, but do not be put off by it's ability to fly under the radar. It was actually pretty darn cool. Considering that it was based on a series of books(?)...do people still read? it was surprisingly entertaining. Honestly, if you don't know about Harry Potter and need to read a review about it then you should probably try and get out of the giant cave you've been hiding in since Y2K. Seriously, you're still reading this? Go. Go away. Beat it. Go watch this and you can then write a review for others to get bummed on...or like. Whatever.

  I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, but when I was growing up they were huge and I can't remember why I never got into them. I suspect I will have to go read them now as the stories told in these eight movies are spectacular. One of the coolest things was to watch each of the kids grow into adults (and I myself am only a few years older than the three main actors). I'll not review the storylines of each movie here because others have done a better job than I could, for certain. However, the flow of each movie was really well done so that the pacing wasn't too fast. I don't know if this was true for those who had read the books, but as a first time introduction to the series it was very satisfying. The special effects were superb as well, but it was the story that Ms. Rowling weaves on book and then each director does to film. A great two weeks worth of watching.On a side note, there are special features on the discs, but they are ""hidden"" on some. There is no menu for the first several movies (the show just immediately starts after previews) so to find them you'd have to press the ""menu"" or ""main"" button. I'm not really sure what button you'd have to press on a DVD or Blu-Ray player because I use my :PS3 for movies and I just press ""square"" to pull up the menu that way. Good luck, if so desired!

  These are great movies but the Chamber of Secrets arrived cracked.  Amazon was helpful enough to replace the entire set.  This was given as a gift to my boyfriend after we lost all of our movies in a tornado last year.  It disappointed him that it was cracked but it was replaced very quickly.

  I ordered Bluray and a small scratch was on the upper right corner of the box- after I opened it I discovered the scratch had punctured the box and scratched the case. The case is still functional but does make me wonder why they would even sell it when it appeared damaged.Nevertheless, it is a small scratch and doesn't influence the functionality of the case. All discs are perfect!

  I love this story - many people do.  The Blu-ray collection looks to be compiled from previously released 2-disc sets of each individual chapter.  I wish there was a 9th disc that had the details on the 2nd discs of the individual chapters.The video quality is utterly amazing.  This is one of the best HD renderings I've seen to date.  Excellent color saturation and luminosity.  The quality is so good that it overtakes the most annoying downfall of some of the chapters... the sound mixing.Sound mixing is a post-production effort that, among many other things, applies volume to desired levels for each of the elements of a film including special effects and dialogue.  It is painfully obvious that the mixing engineer liked the special effects more than the dialogue - especially in the 5th and 6th chapters.  I had to turn off surround sound in the 6th chapter and verify my audio settings because of the inept mixing.  The dialogue audio is extremely quiet when separated out into its own channel on surround on these chapters (it is quiet in other chapters as well, but these 2 are the worst).  To hear the dialogue I had to turn up the volume significantly.  But then when the special effects kick in, the volume is disproportionately harsh.  I get it - explosions are louder than human voices.  But in film - moreso for family films than Rambo-like films - it is traditional to tone down the explosions and tune up the dialogue to balance the audio.  Not here though.  Just beware that this is the case and hold the remote at the ready!Aside from that annoyance, the collection is wonderful.  A must-buy for all HP fans!

  This Harry Potter collection has all the movies that came out to complement the book series of J. K. Rowlings. It's full of drama and action, and the included additional bonus discs show the behind look on how the film was made, is put together,  interviews with the cast, and other interest facts about the making of each movie. This blu-ray version brings the movies to life, especially if projected on a big screen with a HD projector.

  Congratulations! You made it this far in narrowing down your decisions as to which Harry Potter set to get. Seeing as there are what seem like a ton of options for Harry Potter box sets, I'll make this review short and sweet.This set comes in one big box that holds one case that holds all eight Blu-Ray discs - I got the one that is pictured in the product description with the picture of Hogwarts on the front. It's a great set to have if you're looking for a Blu-Ray set of all eight films in one box that is compact and easy to bring on a trip, share with friends, or watch repeatedly.I decided on giving this set four stars instead of five because it's not an ""organized"" set, and here's what I mean: each Blu-Ray disc is just a repackaged version of the ones sold individually - meaning that they don't match, and some discs have more features than others. The menu navigation is also different for each disc so it's confusing as you watch multiple films and the controls aren't the same.Also worth pointing out - my Blu Ray player has issues playing some of these. So far, no issues in the films I've watched with skipping, but some discs take a lot longer to load than what is normal for my machine, and I thought that was odd.All in all, a great set if you're looking for a barebones option. However, if you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan looking for something more substantial, this is not for you. I'd recommend this product. Blessings!

  I bought this on Black Friday, I think, so I got all 8 movies for $40.  Incredible price to get all 8 movies, including HP 7 part 2.  However, when I got it, they do not have individual covers, and there is a broken plastic piece.  Providing the other piece doesnt break, it will be ok.  But for the regular price of like $80...I'd rather buy them all separately , which you can do for less than $50. I purposely didnt buy any of them over the years because I knew there would be a box set, but I didnt know it would be so bare bones.

The movies, in my opinion, are like a highlight reel of the books. I've loved all the movies and it's great to have them in this compact package.

I loved the books as a young adult, I loved the movies as an early adult... but the Blu-Ray collection as a full bird adult? I fell back in love. Revisiting old friends while my husband enjoyed alongside, has to be some of the most fun I've had in my own home viewing experience. Don't hesitate, I found this collection on Amazon while standing at Best Buy. It was $30.00 cheaper on Amazon at the time and I'm so glad I shopped around first.

I'm a huge Harry Potter nerd (Potterhead) and I was so excited when this came that I was jumping up and down. (I'm 22, mind...) The only thing is that if you are expecting special bonus features or anything, it won't be in this. It's just the movies. So the games and stuff that come on the second disc in the individual films isn't included.I'm SO EXCITED to make my husband watch with me. (:

  Brings the Harry Potter movies to beautiful blu-ray. It doesn't include extended versions. There are extras, but maybe not as many as the expensive edition. But for most people, all you really need are these movies in stunning HD quality. The discs don't have a single, exclusive themed picture on them, and the packaging is not fancy. But you don't bend that at this price, right? Just give you the higher quality discs.

But for most people, all you really need are these movies in stunning HD quality. The discs don't have a single, exclusive themed picture on them, and the packaging is not fancy. But you don't bend that at this price, right? Just give you the higher quality discs.

  I just opened this and all the movies are in here and everything but both the blu ray and 4k blu ray set boxes have broken pieces but the shipping box and product box and the outside of the individual cases are perfectly fine just the insides of the cases are broke so the discs just slide around and pop out. I haven't had the chance to check the disks yet but with them sliding around like crazy I hope they work

  The worst thing when buying a new movie is hearing that rattle inside. Have to get a new case for my set now. It was pretty beat up. Disc one and two are damaged and will not play so this is getting returned.

  Got them all and fortunately they work- BUT. The shipping box was fine but the actual DVD case came broken in several ways. It won't even hold the dvds in it. Amazed none of the DVDs were broke or scratched. Now have to go buy a new case for them to keep them safe

  Pros: Blu-ray and all of the movies in one bundle what else needs to be said.  Great collection I have watched over and over again.  You would laugh if you knew how old I am.  Nice to sink into a fantasy world for a while.The Blu-ray case is simple and fine if you aren't trying to purchase the collector's edition.  This edition is very nice if you only want to watch the movies.Cons: Can't think of any at this time.

  This is as most of the low rated reviews have said, a no frills, nothing added as a bonus set. I am fine with this. I can understand the hardcore followers not happy with it because of it's lack of bonus features etc. All I know is that for me (and many other viewers also) it is the best option! It allows me to see all of the movies in great blu-ray quality while STILL saving some money for other movies too. A trade-off I am happy to make.

  I enjoyed watching each Harry Potter movie when they originally came out.  I stopped short of viewing part two of the last movie back then because I just never purchased it.  Buying this complete collection and viewing all of the movies in sequence, made for an exciting, anticipatroy climax when viewing ""The Deathly Hallows Part Two"".  I had a Harry Potter movie marathon, and had a ball!  It is well worth the price.

  I won't even bother reviewing the movies - by now you know if you like them or not.  If you do, and like me, might have bought the earlier ""Years"" on DVD, this is a great way to upgrade to Blu-Ray and have everything in a nice, neat package.  For those looking for tons of extras, postcards, a T-Shirt, etc..., this set is not for you.  But if you want to own the complete collection of what is, arguably, one of the most significant pop culture phenomenons ever, then grab this up.  I like that it is not big and bulky with all those ""extras"" that cost more but add little value.  While it's sad that the series is over, how cool is it that this great collection can keep us enjoying Harry for many years to come!

  This 8-disc blu ray set seemed like such a great deal. Seemed great when it came too until we went to play the first disc. We have a blu ray player and 1080p hdtv. The movie just started to play with no previews or menu which seemed odd. Then the movie started... It was such poor video quality it looked like a bootleg. Our DVD version of the Harry potter movies looks better than these ""blu ray"" copies. The sound quality was also very poor. These were NOT BLU RAY. I don't know what happened because I called customer service and they said they were sold straight from amazon so they could not be counterfeit. But these were not blu ray copies. Thank goodness I was still able to return them

  I love the Harry Potter movies, but my old dvds were in bad shape (I was not gentle on them as a child), so I decided to order new ones.  I appreciate this set because they are all boxed together.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that they are all actually in a single dvd case, which is really nice because it condenses the movies in a smaller space.  The movies all play perfectly and have some special features (Note: this is not a collectors edition, so it does not have super extended features, but is still nice all the same).

  I'm a big Harry Potter fan and I was so excited to get the whole collection. My only complaint/concern is the printing on one of the discs is very odd. It doesn't match the style (font, photos, etc.) of any of the other discs, and it's off centered. It almost looks as though someone created the label at home, printed it off and stuck it to a burned disc. However, the movie plays normally including the menu and special features so I'm not too worried.

  The Harry Potter series of eight movies in one jacket is a treasure trove for the fantasy-minded. What a trip!! I loved watching all eight movies, and when I get them back from my good friend, to whom I lent them, I will most likely watch them all, again. Highly recommended for you fantasy lovers out there. If you have seen one or two of the movies, see them all. They are worth it.

The first one came with the spine broken inside so the leaves would slide all over and fall out.  It was replaced immediately with no wait so we were delighted with the service!

  I purchased the 8 disc set and it's very obvious that the last 3 movies (half blood prince and deathly hallows 1&2) are from their own sets. Out of the 8 movies they're the only ones with ads before the movie and the discs themselves all say ""movie"" on them. Half blood prince actually says ""disc 1 movie"" which tells me there's a disc 2 somewhere with special features or something like that. In the end I don't mind cause I mostly wanted the movies, just something to note.Also, my deathly hallows part 2 movie won't play on my ps4 unless I disconnect the internet from it which is annoying but not the end of the world.

  As a fan of the books I was blown away with each movie. I mean some left out details and such, but when you have a collective group of people who are trying to make the best movie possible, you can overlook those missing details. The cast has improved with each film and the effects have become spectacular. Watching these books come to life has been an honor and a privilege. I have seen many movies that have come from books, but I have never seen them portrayed as real and as true to the book as these movies. With the exception of 'To Kill a Mockingbird'. These films are fantastic and I would recommend them to anyone. Regardless if you've read the books, you will enjoy these movies and hopefully come to love them as I do.

  I bought this product for my wife for Christmas. I hadn't seen these movies before, but am up to Half-Blood Prince and enjoy them quite a bit. My only complaint is that the product shipped Half-Blood Prince damaged. I tried watching it last night for the first time, and the disc would not read. I noticed there was damage from the plastic tray it sits in and the Blu-Ray disc had damage. It is a shame, but I went ahead and bought the single Blu-Ray disc to replace it.

  My movie set box was damaged upon arrival. The box was obviously used, but movies looked fine. Just got through movies 1-5 in the past couple of weeks. Went to watch movie 6 tonight (Half-Blood Prince) and the movie is defective and does not play. The movie looks different than all the other movies. I am assuming it is fake and am very, VERY, disappointed in the quality of the product and the inability to get a refund.

  I love these movies, and its really nice to have a set which contains them all. This set came in a single dvd case, about twice as thick as a standard case, with plastic pages that can be flipped like a book to find a specific dvd. This is nice, because I can have 8 movies in the space that is usually required for two.The internal part of the case that holds the pages and allows them to rotate was broken, when it arrived, and I have to be careful when selecting a disc. However, none of the discs appear to be damaged, and I got a great deal on the set, so I am not really bothered by it.

  The Harry Potter series is 5 stars, hands down but I wasn't too impressed with this being their first complete Blu-Ray boxed set. The extended versions aren't on it either as you need to buy the more expensive version that I wasn't impressed with. A more economical buy though and comes with a cool cover that brings you back to the first movie.

  I watched a few of these movies last year and this year while wrapping all my presents last minute. Maybe its the Christmas/winter scenes, the warm fires in the common room, and the close friendships/family dynamics, because HP seems perfect for the holiday season. The Blu-ray is good. There are no real bonuses or extras, but I don't watch that stuff anyway. I also got these last year for a Black Friday price, so the cost was worth it.

I do however prefer it that way as it saves space on the movie rack. All disc fit safely in the case. Very happy to have the whole collection at my finger tips.

  Before buying this 8 disc blu-ray set of Harry Potter, I saw reviews that indicated it did not include extra information.  I bought the set anyway, since we don't really care about extra cuts, etc.  However, after browsing around, we found plenty of extra information including interviews and cuts.  We are happy with the set - we got exactly what we wanted, which is a complete set of HP on blu-ray discs.  We also got some extras that we had not counted on.  So, all is well.

  This set is exactly what I was looking for. I am reading the series (some books for the first time, some for the second) and I wanted the movies so that I could watch them after I finish the books. I don't use all the extras movies offer such as behind the scenes views or commentaries, etc. I didn't need all the bells and whistles, I just wanted to watch the movies. This was perfect! It's a simple set that has only what I need. If you're looking for some great collector's edition, this is not for you. However, if you're like me and just want the basic movie, this set is ideal and definitely worth the price!

  Very disappointed with. I love Harry Potter. I purchased this so that I would have all the movies. I have watched the movies on TV countless times and still do. The problem I have with product is that each move has parts of scenes ""CUT"". Having watch these movies before and pretty much know what is in the scenes and find it has been cut out is very disappointing. Granted the parts cut did not change the story's plot line but it takes away from the enjoyment of watching because you know the movie you paid good money for is incomlpete.

  Loved these movies in theaters and it plays beautifullly on my plasma tv. Only gripe is that it's in a wide format so there are black zones on the top and bottom of the screen that I couldn't get rid of with tv settings without messing the picture too bad. However, the box is highly collectible and the extra footage is awesome.

  I just received my package, and I'm very happy with the quality of package. I must admit that I was a little hesitant to buy this edition, thanks to the reviews, but for the price is the best option that you can ever have. Some people complain about the missing extended editions, but let's face it none of the movies from the 3rd one to the last one, ever had an extended edition included. Unless, that you work for Wanner Bros there is no way that you can have access to those editions. The only reason why i give this 4 stars is the Ultraviolet digital copy, I wish it was ITunes but that is just a personal opinion since i use more Itunes than any other digital copy service. In conclusion if you are not a hardcore fan that is waiting for some edition released in a package made from Phoenix feathers and rock incrustations from Hogwarts' facade. Go ahead buy this set before it's gone.

  Comes in a great case, sturdy and thick. the discs are nicely displayed. Looks great when watched. My problems are that it is wide screen, which you can't tell from looking at the box, and that disc 7 part 1 has no cover art. While the other movies have a picture of Harry/Ron/Hermione, 7 part 1 is totally black and says ""harry potter movie"". I have not seen the actual disc for 7 part 1 and it is definitely possible that it never had a cover art. I would have been disappointed if I had paid full price, but I got this one on sale for $80. Seeing as in my town it can only be found 1-7 part 1 for $140 this was a great deal. Love the series! Overall I have recommended this to many and would continue to do so!

  Preface: Love,love, LOVE Harry Potter. This was a sweet deal at about 80$, that's 10$ per each blu-ray dvd, which is a steal. Quality was great but on the second disk (HP and the Chamber of secrets) there's about a 7 minute lapse, basically the disk just fast forwards the 7 minutes regardless of what you do. It's not a huge deal, and it's the only problem out of all eight disks so I'm not gonna bother sending it back.

  I really enjoyed watching the Harry Potter movies. They are enjoyable for both kids and adults to watch!  This DVD set had been sitting on my amazon wish list for quite a while, so when it was on sale for black Friday, I jumped at the chance to snag this set at a cheaper price. The box set is small, not bulky, so it fits nicely on my DVD shelf. I ordered this set along with a few other items and my package never arrived, although amazon said it was delivered (I think it was stolen from my mail). I had never had a package not arrive before so I waited a few extra days and contacted the seller. They immediately sent out a new one, free of charge, with expedited shipping! Such great customer service!  The movies came well before Christmas (which I was hoping for) and were a big hit with my family. We have already watched them multiple times, and it is fun for the whole family to have a movie night or Harry Potter marathon.

  I haven’t been able to test each DVD yet? But it did come in sealed packaging and a nice case. As I inspected each disc (other reviews said they were in poor condition), there are minor smudges, but nothing looks too bad. However, the movies weren’t in order I’m the case and the movie organizer is separate from the case. Over all, it seems to get the job done, but it poorly presented.

  First let me say I have been shopping with Amazon for years and have had a few minor issues which were handled with satisfactory results.  I ordered this for my grandson for Christmas so he could watch the movies from his X-Box. We were not aware the X-Box would not accommodate Blu-Ray and returned it for the regular DVD version.  My return was accepted BUT was told a 26% restocking fee had been deducted from the refund!!! While Amazon's return policies state that they have no control over their outside sources fees, there is NO mention of restocking fees on the product page much less that outrageous amount.  Had I been made aware of restocking fees on the PRODUCT PAGE I would have not ordered it; or had the fees been more REASONABLE, I would have borne no ill will.  Now I am very angry and upset with both Amazon and the shipper as you can probably tell..BUYER BEWARE certainly holds true...as to the regular DVD set, grandson is thoroughly enjoying the collection.

  So obviously a bootleg that it’s not even funny. Should’ve been common sense obviously a box set of all eight movies. Never cost less than $50.

  This set was on sale when I purchased it, so of course I had to snag it! It comes in a very nice case (essentially a large version of one DVD case that you can flip through to pick which one) that holds all of the DVD’s in it. Came on time and I’m more than pleased with the packaging, no complaints whatsoever!

  I very recently purchased a blu-ray player for my brand new HDTV, and I desperately wanted something I knew would look amazing in hi-def.  Needless to say, I went with Harry Potter (one of my all time favorites).  I wasn't particularly bothered by these not being the ""special editions"", and for what I paid for these, I thought the box set was quite nice.  The only odd thing I noticed was that these must either be Canadian editions or UK editions, since the ratings were a little out of the ordinary, and the first movie is ""the Philosopher's Stone"" vs ""the Sorcerer's Stone"", which is what I'm use to seeing.

By the time the last two books came out, they were able to deal with the content. Same with the movies. I wonder if original Hobbit readers felt the same way with The Lord of the Rings. Anyway, Great films. Wonderful collection.

  This would be perfect save there is no real menu system on the discs, I mean when you insert them, they just start the movie- of course, could just be something the Xbox One does, but I had to top menu and search for even the most basic settings. Still, they all play nicely and you can't wrong if you love Hermoine Granger - I mean Harry Potter, of course. If I had to do it over again, I would have gotten the multiformat set instead as I would like to watch them in my van late at night with Allison and Ellie - although I could use the PS3 on the van's RCA interface. It's cozy and the screen in small but it's cozy and being locked in a van with the people you love sounds great until someone has to go to the bathroom.Outside of the weird menu UI - it is more compact than juggling multiple cases and memorabilia- unless you like showing off your elder wand and butter beer stein between disks. Then,by all means, get robed up and go around exclaim spells and picking on house elfs...or not. Ellie says that we should make the elves polka-dot socks to wear- I suspect she knows that Allison is secretly annoyed by the idea of polka dots socks though. I assure them both Hermoine wouldn't hear of any such foolishness. I would have preferred that she and Harry could have had the relationship instead though but I respect that the story writes itself.

(he shared the party w/ a very young cousin. had her open it. then said it was a gift for the both of them to share!) Needless to say my mom had to settle some things in my absence. But now he has the set, and couldn't be happier!

  For the price of 8 movies its totally worth it, but my only dislike about this collection is that it doesn't have all the special features that the single movies had. The first few movies have a significant amount of features but the later ones have almost no features. So if you want loads of features I'd say buy the movies individually. But If your just looking to enjoy the films , there's nothing wrong with this collection.

  I purposefully waited until all the Harry Potter movies were released so that I could buy a complete set. I don't regret buying this set at all, because I mainly just wanted to own the movies, I was slightly disappointed that there were no (and I mean NO) special features whatsoever. I wasn't expecting hours long SF, but I thought each movie would come with at least one SF. Also, I don't know whether it's a special setting, but each of the movies started automatically playing after a certain amount of time on the DVD main menu screen, even when the movie had been watched already. Again, not a major complaint, just an observation.All in all, I like that the set is small and doesn't take up an entire DVD shelf, but this is most definitely only the set for you if you want the movies and nothing else. There is nothing 'collectable' about it.

  The process of ordering and receiving the collection was very smooth and prompt.  Things went south during the viewing of Deathly Hallows, which we viewed first from the set.  Several times the screen became very dark, and in some places we had to guess what was happening.  We don't know if if is a problem with the quality of the disks, or of our player, but it occurred with one or two of the others, too.  It somewhat dampened our enthusiasm and enjoyment of the videos.

  This seems like a mix and match of Harry Potter films from different collections.  Films 1-5 are clearly from the same collection, but then Film 6 has a different menu entirely (and the disc itself says ""Disc 1"" on it, indicating that it was originally part of single-set coming with a 2nd disc).  Films 7 and 8 also have different menus.  The films themselves are great, quality is great, but calling it a ""collection"" indicates that the discs were made to be in the same collection, which isn't the case with what I received.

  EACH DISC FREEZES AND SKIPS. The 5th disc froze and wouldn't go any further. I misded key moments in each of the movies. The seventh disc, part one froze half way through and wouldbt continue. For the price and the fact that they're bluray, I expected more and am completely disappointed.

  I bought this during Thanksgiving weekend and received it on the 3rd of December. I purchased it new, but upon opening the package it felt as if the box itself was a bit greasy. I thought it might've been my imagination so I just ignored it.When opening the DVD case, I was disappointed it was just a silver disc with the movie title, but that's quickly to get over. What I couldn't get over was the fact that there were fingerprint smudges  all over on each of the discs (my first thought that someone was eating a bag of chips and decided to pop in the DVDs) and with that, scratches on both sides! Upon further investigation, I realized that even the movie titles on the discs weren't even of the same size. And where each was dark and bold in the lettering, Prisoner of Azkban was light and faded looking as if a different font was used. Making me question the whole collection even more.I, of course, returned it.

  Best Movie Collection EVER!!! At least, that is what my son thinks.Let me set the scene in my household. I have a 6 year old son that gets so wrapped up in things that it becomes his reality. I love how this kids imagination just runs wild with whatever it is he gets into. He loves Star Wars, Legos, Ninja Turtles, Transformers, etc etc etc, basically all things that a young boy would just love.I purchased this movie set for my wife for a Christmas gift because she loved the books and the movies (truth be told, so do I). I thought that it would be a fun thing for us to have for nights when the kids go to bed early, something fun for us to cuddle up with each other on the couch and enjoy. What I didn't realize is how it would transform my son's world into a world of magic, spells, and wands.My wife showed the first movie to our 3 older kids (9 year old daughter who has read all of the books, 6 year old son, and ~3 year old daughter) one day during the Christmas break after they had finished their chores. My daughter knew what to expect b/c she has read the whole series, but my son was just captivated. He loved everything about the movie and wanted to watch more. The kids ended up watching the whole series (minus a few scary parts when we had them cover their eyes) over the course of the next week. Since that time, my son has wanted to do nothing but watch, read, and play Harry Potter. I am reading the books to him each night before bed and we are just finishing up the 3rd book. He purchased a couple of Harry Potter Lego sets with money that he earned doing chores. We even ended up buying a couple of replica wands for each of the kids for Valentine's Day gifts.I love how wrapped up into this world he has become. He will go outside after school and has now convinced several of the neighborhood kids to play Harry Potter. They all have wands, run around casting spells at each other. They have a fantastic time doing it and it is all in good fun. The other day, my almost 3 year old started casting spells at me. She only knows one spell, the Avada Kedavra spell, which of course is the death or killing spell. She can't quite say it right, but it is the cutest thing in the world to hear her yelling spells at me or her brother just so that she can play along too.I love this movie set too, but not just because they are good movies. I really love how much they have opened up the minds of my kids and helped them to see the joy of books and using their imaginations to play. My daughter loved this book series and she has now started into other series of books. My son tries to read the books on his own, and he is getting much better at reading because he is so focused on it. It also is fun to go down into his room at night and read with him, and have him want to listen and spend time with me. I couldn't be more pleased and thankful to own these movies now. I can't recommend this series more to anyone that has kids and wants to find ways to spark creativity, curiosity, and even motivate those kids to want to read.

  Ordered this knowing it would be a simple version of the beloved Harry Potter series. However, the actual DVDs had spots before I even used them. That's fine except I can't even play the movies - they constantly skip. I could've looked past the super cheap casing and makeshift root menus but not even being able to watch the movies themselves was quite a disappointment. If you want to enjoy these movies, do not buy this set.

  I read the reviews before buying this product and some of them were pretty outrageous. This is a box set of all the Harry Potter movies, nothing more, nothing less. It has an exterior box which houses the plastic container holding all eight films. Some people talk about how flimsy the casing is, but it is just what you would expect from any blu-ray box set. Slam dunk purchase if you enjoy the Harry Potter films and haven't picked them up on blu-ray yet!

  I read the reviews before buying this product and some of them were pretty outrageous. This is a box set of all the Harry Potter movies, nothing more, nothing less. It has an exterior box which houses the plastic container holding all eight films. Some people talk about how flimsy the casing is, but it is just what you would expect from any blu-ray box set. Slam dunk purchase if you enjoy the Harry Potter films and haven't picked them up on blu-ray yet!

  Better than expected! I bought this because I was missing some of the movies and my mom and I have so many different sets that I couldn't remember which was mine or hers. It's actually much thinner and lighter than I anticipated which makes it perfect for travel!

  I see lots of people complaining about the lack of extra features with this set. That's not a problem for me. I bought this set as a Christmas present for my daughter. She's not interested in commentaries and other extra stuff. She just likes to watch the movies, so this is perfect for her. The Amazon price was $48 when I ordered mine last week (and it qualified for free shipping, which only takes a day or two longer in my experience). That works out to $6 per movie, a pretty good price in my opinion. And logging in today to write this review, I see the price has dropped to $39.99. That works out to $5 per movie, an even better deal.If you're not interested in all the extra stuff (that people will pay a lot more money for when the super duper amazing deluxe set is released in the future) and just like to watch the movies, this collection is a good option. It's convenient to have all the movies in one compact set at a great price.On a side note, I was in Walmart yesterday and noticed they're selling this set for $70.

The title screens are cool though and are a nicely edited loop instead of just a picture. I didn't expect that but it really makes the DVDs seem polished. The packaging is somewhat nice but is very simple. If you are a die hard fan this collection isn't for you. But if you just wanted the movies like I did then it is absolutely perfect.

  Unfortunately, one of the disks arrived scratched.  It took us a while to determine this as it was #7 in the series.  There is a time limit on being able to return it, and I am stuck w/it.The movies are great, but I would suggest evaluating them carefully when they arrive.

  The movie is great, but was not new: it was repackaged. Fingerprints on the disk  Not happy about that but will keep the movie long enough to make sure all disks work properly. The movie itself is well worth it.

  My daughter requested a set of the Harry Potter movies for her birthday.  She was not looking for anything fancy -- no collector item type sets, she didn't need any of the many ""extras.""  She just wanted the movies.  And that is what she got with this reasonably priced set.  Only (small) complaint was that the case for the DVDs was a little broken on the inside. Didn't affect the movies at all, but it did make it a little less than worth a 5 star rating.

  Got this at a great price. Item is in tact and the films are amazing!!!UPDATE 2/26/2017:We only got through the first couple movies until now. We were on a Harry Potter binge with some friends and when we got to The Half Blood Prince the bluray player wouldn't play the film. We inspected the disc and saw it was scratched up and it had a different look than the rest of the blurays. Our copy of The Half Blood Prince says ""Disc 1 Movie"" and the bluray disc symbol is different. (Check out the photos I've attached.) This is the first time we've tried watching The Half Blood Prince. Does anyone know how we can contact the seller to get a replacement? I'm worried since I purchased this in November 2015 that it's too late, but this is the first time we've really tried watching all the films from this set. I should've looked more thoroughly through the discs when we got them. It was in plastic when we received it so I thought nothing of it. Any help is greatly appreciated. If this issue gets resolved I'll be changing my rating to 5 stars definitely!

I really thought that since we paid so much that they would be brand new... they were not for me. After receiving the second replacement and seen that they were less damaged I just gave up on hope that i would receive a good condition movie set.

  I had seen most of the HP movies, but my husband hadn't seen any of them. We purchased this to watch over our holiday break. The quality was good, it wasn’t HD, but we were both still very happy with it. Also, the product arrived in a timely manner. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to watch the series. It isn't a collector’s item, but it gets the job done!

  This is a good collection of all the movies for a great price, although I wouldn't order it from Amazon in this case.  It is actually cheaper from the warner brothers website.  I payed about $45 for the set.  It doesn't have any of the ""extra"" stuff like special features and behind the scenes, but I don't like watching much of that anyways.  Over all, it is a very nice set.

  I'm in my 50's and have never seen any Harry Potter movies or read any Harry Potter books. I like sets or collections where I can see a beginning and end without waiting years so this set appealed to me. I really enjoyed it. They movies were longbut I was drawn in and couldn't wait to see the next.

  I have been waiting and waiting for the last movie to come out before I bought any HP DVD's so I would have the boxed set.  So, when the last movie was due to come out on DVD I went on Amazon to see it.  I expected to pay around $100 (a little over $10 per movie seemed fair) but found it for half that.  There has been some comments on here about these not being the extended editions.....what tripe.  They come with bonus scenes, and I am NOT going to wait another year for the extended ones to come out.  I wanted to have a Harry Potter Marathon with my kids, I had already waited several years for the boxed set, and it did not disappoint.  I will probably look in to buying the extended boxed set when they come out...but until then I love these and recomend them to any Harry Potter fan.

  I bought this in 2013.  I still have this.  It is still my favorite pack to go to on my movie nights/binge weekends.  It even has scenes that are cut out when these are shown on tv.Right after I got this, I spent an entire month in Harry Potter land.  Every day after work, and on the weekends, I would play all of the movies over and over again, start to finish.  I even bought a variety of candy to go along with the initial train ride to Hogwarts.Many years ago, I was given the first 4 books as a birthday present.  At first I didn't think I was going to like them, but apparently my parents know me much better than I do in some areas.  They were absolutely right to get me those books because even though I was 25 years old at the time, they became some of my favorite books ever.  I wanted to have all of the movies so I could lose myself in the make believe world, and now I have them.The quality is fantastic, as mentioned they show scenes you may not have seen, they are still in excellent condition, no skips, no scratches...if you're a huge Harry Potter fan, and you want to get away from the real world for awhile, you cannot go wrong purchasing this set.

I wanted to have all of the movies so I could lose myself in the make believe world, and now I have them.The quality is fantastic, as mentioned they show scenes you may not have seen, they are still in excellent condition, no skips, no scratches...if you're a huge Harry Potter fan, and you want to get away from the real world for awhile, you cannot go wrong purchasing this set.

  At first look the box looked used. The paint on the sides were scratched and rubbing off. So I opened it only to find that all the cds were different. 3 of them looked as if they took the cds from other movies and the other 5 looked liked copies. Very disappointed especially for the amount I paid.

  Harry Potter. Need I say more? Haha, I heard that the HP movies were going to be placed into a 'vault' (that's what my friends and I call it, kind of like the Disney vault) I knew I had to get the movies. So I waited for HP Deathly Hallows Part 2 to be released on DVD to see what kind of packages they had. I liked this one and it was cheaper than Target!

  The transfers themselves onto BluRay for the first five films looks absolutely gorgeous. Smooth, crisp, vivid, delicious 5.1 audio. My only two complaints are that it features very little bonus material, and the packaging and BluRay art are just taken from previous BluRay releases, and feature 'Disc 1' written on them. And the Deathly Hallows Part 1 is literally just black with the name written on it, which looks very cheap and out of place among the others. But if you don't care about the bells and whistles and just want the films in excellent HD quality, then this collection is for you.

  This is just judging the blu-ray discs and the packaging itself not the movie.So it was delivered with the middle piece hinge with a crack in it and some of the placeholders for the discs were broken (the pizza piece as I call it)Then there were the movies themselves. They basically cannibalized blu-ray discs from all the unused blu-rays that didnt sell I guess.For EX: theres a DISC 1 on one of the movies when there is no DISC 2The audio on the first 5 discs is wonky.  It just doesnt sound right.6-8 the audio is good but all of the sudden the video gets super dark so you have to turn up the brightness.Tried this out on the PS3 and even switched back to an old dedicated blu-ray player to see if the problems still followed.They did.It is relatively cheap though but if I had to do it over again I would have spent some extra money on a version that didnt have these problems.

But WB dropped the friggin' ball on this one. Big Time.No primary menus; it's a text block.These BD were culled from spare BD single film Special Editions. Most will list the film's name and denote ""Disc One"", when it is the third or fourth movie in the series. This was not a version made for casual fans. This is nothing more than WB redressing their over stock and calling it a new BD boxed set. Way to go, WB. Had you done it right, it'd actually be worth the exuberant price tag, even with Amazon discounts.

When it came, I was doubly delighted as the 8-disc set was in a compact box about the width of 3 regular DVD boxes, instead of an obnoxious larger box that takes up way too much room on my DVD shelf.  Yes, there are fancier boxed sets out there, but I just wanted it for the movies, not for a collection, so this was perfect.The fact that it arrived just 4 days after I ordered it was an added bonus.

  No finer collection of DVD's than all seven of the Harry Potter books. There is actually 8 DVD's because Book 7 was so long.. Your kids and adults will  remain merized at the content of these DVD's. Some of the best writing for the ages.  The first 3 adventures are fun and suitable for most audiences. By the time you watch #4, the content becomes a little more challenging. With #4 under your belt, the content becomes a little more darker and you should preview the material before you clear it for your younger kids to watchThe movies are so well done.  The screen play and adaptations are marvelous.The music is wonderful and the acting is ""right on."" These classics should be in everyone's DVD library. Their content won't grow old.. The main characters grow up before your very eyes.And don't get too hung up on the mention of the black arts. I am sure that your kids' experiences everyday in elementary school are far more blacker than Potter's adventures. So don't miss out.

  I bought this Bluray set as a gift for the holidays. At first it was very disappointing as the person I gave it to reported that the discs didnt play correctly and often skipped past sections of the films making them unwatchable. I did some research and I urge everyone who has had playback issues to look into this, check your model of bluray player and check to make sure you have UPDATED THE FIRMWARE! Issues were on a Samsung BDP-1600 which was running 1.01 firmware, upgrading to the latest 2.19 firmware fixed the playback issues - there is nothing wrong with the discs in this set.

I'm severely disappointed in Amazon.

  Great set and a cheap way to get all the HP movies. It looks like random extra discs were used to fill this set (i.e. they don't match and one disc lacks a cover picture all together), so if you are looking for a timeless, beautiful display set, this is not it. Serves its purpose for me, though.

As the grandchildren grow and their parents want to share Harry Potter with them the movies will be a great addition to the books.

  It's true that the movies leave a lot of things from the book out.  Of course, the books are so rich and full of detail that it would be impossible for anyone to create a truly accurate film that would be short enough for a theatrical release.  However, the cinematography, sets, filming locations, and performances of some of Britain's finest actors make this film adaptation nearly perfect.

  Having not purchased these movies before, owning all 8 movies in one compact package is super convenient.  The movies look amazing on my samsung lcd/blue ray player, and the audio is top rate as well. Each film is the theatrical release and has the usual behind the scenes reel, as well as deleted scenes selections.  Since most of the movies are in excess of 2.5 hours anyway, I don't feel cheated not having the edited scenes incorporated into the films, a la the directors cuts of the Lord of the Rings series. My only issue involves the packaging. Some of the discs come loose quite easily, risking damage with rough handling. Otherwise, very pleased with this package.

  I purchased this item for my son for Christmas.  It was on sale at that time for $40 or so.  All the discs work and are in good condition. I am very happy with the discs themselves and he loves having them.  My single complaint is that the inside tabs of the case broken within moments of being open.  Does it matter? No.  I'm ok with it.  The discs still stay safe inside and are contained.  For the price, it's great!!

  It would be 5, but when I bought this I didn't expect them to just take disc one out of all eight movies package it together and call it the complete set.  There are no bonus features for most of these, as it is on disc two.  I wish they had specified this.  Made me a very unhappy customer.

  Our family had all the Harry Potter movies on DVD bought as each were released. Over the years they have been scratched, lost etc.Luckily Santa saw fit to upgrade us to the BlueRay set. Thanks Santa!As huge fans of the movies and books these will get a lot of watching. The price is right for all the movies. It is a set to watch and enjoy.Fans will enjoy the magic and mystery. As the movies get darker as they progress in theme there is still a sense of wonder and magic on them. The sets and cinematography cannot be denied.The 3 main young cast members earned their acting chops as they grew older in each subsequent movie. They were blessed to work alongside some amazing actors to learn from. RIP Alan Rickman!The characters are great with so much depth to them.While the movies are fantastic I strongly recommend the books. They are even better.I am 41 and I am a Harry Potter nerd. Always.

It makes me sad to know that even though my product was packed with bubble wrap in the box, it was clear that whoever handled the product during shipping just chucked the box around like nothing.

  Do not purchase this product simply because it is missing many many scenes from the actual movie and is very poor quality. I bought this series for a friends birthday in march and just now realized after two months that the DVDs were missing many scenes.  During the first movie where Harry Potter is in Snape's class and he is writing notes then proceeds to ask Harry Potter questions but he can't answer them, it should be where he tells Snape that he should ask hermonie because she clearly knew is completely gone and that is just one scene we realized it.  I contacted customer service and all I was told was that I could return the DVDs and only get half of my money back because it was past the time of return.  I will not lose my money to another broken amazon DVD just to be told to send it back and only get half my money back. DONT BUY THESE!

  I love Harry Potter and watch the marathons so much that I know the movies forward and backward. So, I was a bit disappointed when watching these movies that I purchased because every single one has multiple scenes cut from them. Nowhere in the description did it say that these were the cut movies. Even the televised versions of these movies do not cut these scenes which, I feel, are important to the storyline.

  I didn't get into Lord of the Rings ,one doesn't have to like every book or movie but this was interesting enought and very easy reading. Adults don't like books with big words all the time. Make believe is wonderful to take the tention away for awhile before heading into the real world again.

  The movies themselves were good and Blu-ray quality and all that jazz.  Only complaint is that it doesn't come with any of the extras you might get if you purchase the individual one (behind the scenes stuff and whatnot) but if you don't care about that then this is a 5/5 for sure!

  I bought this back at Christmas on sale. I was a little nervous because I've had bad luck buying movies off Amazon but I really wanted to get these for my husband. Our dvd copies are scratched and no longer play without skipping so I knew I wanted to replace them with blu-ray discs. This was the cheapest option. All the movies play. Our cardboard box was a little roughed up on a corner but we don't mind. The cardboard box is very thin though. The case is one big thick case and you open it up to flip through the discs. I like that they are not stacked. All discs looked new. The only thing that I found odd was that they are not a matching set. It looks kinda like they were each taken from the original release design and just combined into a set which you can see by the pictures. All in all I am super pleased for the price!

  I LOVE HARRY POTTER! My husband got me this as a surprise for my birthday and I jumped with job. It's so much clearer  than the regular DVD's and it was worth every penny. I'm a huge fan so I'm into all things Harry Potter and this was great! I watch them often and I recommend it to everyone. The casing is great too!

  Hey, it's Harry Potter, how could it NOT be ""practically perfect in every way""?The only issue I have is a technical one, and only on one DVD, disk 8, Deathly Hallows, Pt 2. The sound for the voices is subdued into the background soundtrack. In order to understand what was being said, I had to turn on (and read) the subtitles. Disk 8, Deathly Hallows, Pt 2, was the only DVD I had this issue with (with this collection/set; however, I also had this issue with my Lord of the Rings extended version trilogy set as well).Message to J. K. Rowling: From the bottom of my heart, humbly, thank you for creating the Harry Potter series. It meant more to me than you can ever know.

  I really love this collection.  Does it come with EVERYTHING that a hardcore Potter fan wants?  No.  It's still missing extended editions of movies 3-8.  There are lines that I've seen in trailers and BTS footage that are nowhere to be found in the deleted scenes.  There's probably still unseen BTS stuff that Warner Bros. hasn't released.However, this is a really awesome collection.  Prior to purchasing this, I had just bought each DVD individually when they were released, so all the bonus features in this are incredible to me.  Some of them are the same things that were on my versions of the DVDs, but there's a ton of new stuff as well.  Like many Potter fans, I'm sure, I was considering buying the Wizard's Collection, but it was just so expensive that I held back.  This, from my research on the collections, is the same thing as the Wizard's Collection without all the collectibles.  For $150 less (give or take depending on Amazon price fluctuation), this is just what I was looking for.The ""Creating the World of Harry Potter"" segments are amazing and very long.  There are bits and pieces of interviews that overlap in various special feature segments, but for the most part, it's all different footage and interviews.  The book that Hagrid gives Harry with pictures of his parents is exactly what the book this comes in reminds me of.  The DVDs have their own sleeves within the book and I think they're well placed to not be damaged.  The only semi-bad thing I've found is that the number of DVDs might mislead you into thinking there's more special features in this than there actually is.  There's actually only one or two DVDs per movie with special features.  Two of the DVDs for each film are dedicated almost exclusively to the movie itself (Blu-Ray and regular version each get their own disc).  That said, there's still a ton of special features in this collection and, in my opinion, is worth the buy.

  As a big fan of the Harry Potter books, naturally I'm a big fan of the movies. I love having all these DVDs and I feel as though I get to watch the characters grow and develop over the years. They've come to be my ""sick time on the couch"" videos, perfect for those winter colds and flus.

  All the people who are putting negative comments on this dvd set just because it doesn't have extras are ridiculous. The title says it all: 8 complete films, period. I am VERY satisfied with just the films, that's all I need. And I only paid 39.00 for 8 movies - that's one heck of a deal!I love the case it comes in personally. Stylish, and convenient in the way it stores all the discs. All my discs came with pictures on them (none of them blank), so i'm happy with that. Good quality too.So if you're a Harry Potter fan I recommend this DVD set, for sure.

  I really love the books and movies so I decided that I would buy the movies in the set. While there in nothing wrong with packaging or anything along those lines, there is definitely an issue with the voice track lining up with the mouths of the actors as they speak. There was a bit of a delay so they would start speaking but their voices didn't start for a moment. I almost feel as though I am watching a movie on mute and listening to an audio track at the same time. I know that sounds weird but that's the only way I can describe that. If I were rating the actual plot of the movie it would be 5-stars but that really wouldn't help anyone contemplating purchasing this.While I would love a better copy it really isn't worth the time to send it back, especially if they are using our returns as against your standing with amazon, as I just read they are doing - regardless if your returns are for defective materials etc. For the money you spend on the Blu-ray I definitely think that this problem should be fixed. That way people don't have to return it.

  I LOVE Harry Potter and have been trying to find an 8 disc blu rey set for a while now, at first I was looking into getting a set where the movies are in individual movie cases, but after finding this set, i'm happy I got this one instead. Some of the discs have special features and inside looks at the movie. It's not only set at a great price, it also saves a lot of space.

  I purchased the 8 film collection only to have multiple movies out of the set completely not work with both of my blu ray players (Xbox One and Samsung) The codes I received from my Xbox stated that the movies were not original titles, but, copies. Disc six didn't even match the artwork which was consistent throughout the remainder of the discs. Only disc 7 had a dvd menu to access the bonus features, which are clearly listed on the back of the box, the three movies that played did so as soon as the dvd tray closed.I asked for a replacement to this set. When they arrived the case was the same, the disc artwork the same, however, the technical issues were with different disc numbers.Although the shipping was expedient the product is sub par and are believed to be copies instead of originals.I shant purchase any further iterations of this set from these muggles.

  Got this so all my HP movies match.  I didn't think there were any special features, but I don't usually watch them more than once so I wasn't concerned.  They do have some extras, though, for each movie.  Didn't care if it was DVD or Blu Ray, but the Blu Ray is a plus with these beautiful scenes.

  3 discs skip and also get stuck... very disappointed esp when getting to the last DVD and couldn't watch.  I love HP and hadn't had a chance to finish reading books, so I bought this set.  You might want to buy individually as at least I had one of the 3 disc's that don't play and able to watch.  Note: I used right out of the box and holder's, didn't place my fingers on dvd's, tried cleaning the 3 bad disc's and cleaned my player just in case... still didn't/don't play.  Really was hoping to give this a 5 star review.  PS:  I don't stream movies due to older tech products... thus don't use a lot of my benefits being a Prime Member, so if you can stream these, you might want to use this method vs buying.

We wanted to watch the movies that were not on regular TV of how they were on the big screens.  This was ideal for that situation.  Amazing how much better the movies are after you read the books!  Now we have all of the movies and can watch when we want.

  This item is great! I'm not a diehard fan but I wanted the whole set of movies so that when my niece finishes the books we can watch the movies in order. It is a great price for just the basic movies (dvds are just repackaged singles) that would've cost double had I bought them all separately. If you are looking for a ton of extras, behind-the-scenes, etc this is not the right product for you but if you are just looking at having the movies on your shelf for future Harry Potter weekend marathons... it is perfect! The only reason I did not give this a 5-star rating is that the case is pretty flimsy and the plastic pieces on the inside that holds the movies in place broke about 30 seconds after I opened it.

  This is a review on this specific movie set. NOT A REVIEW OF THE MOVIES!Nobody can argue the greatness of Harry Potter.Anyway...I ordered the 8 film bluray set of Harry Potter with the castle on the front as a gift for Christmas. I was super excited to give this set because I expected it to be a pretty nice high quality bluray set.I was wrong...The set did come with all 8 movies, but it looks like each disc came from a different set. None of the discs match. In fact, the sixth movie, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince says ""Disc 1 Movie"" on the disc when there's only 1 disc. And The Deathly Hallows Part One says ""The Movie"" on the disc implying that there is a second disc with bonus features or something for that movie as well. Like I said, it just seems like they grabbed random discs from other sets to make one complete set with all the movies.I'm beginning to wonder if there's ever going to be a beautiful set of Harry Potter on bluray where all the discs match and look like they belong in one nice cohesive set.I've read a few reviews on this specific set and a few people complain that the third movie which should be Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is actually the movie Polar Express when they put it in their bluray player.I'll wait for confirmation from the gift receiver to find out if the third movie is the real third movie...

If you are a person who doesn't care about the extra hours upon hours of bonus material that comes on the Blu-Ray set, then this is the set for you. You'll save money and be able to watch all the films as you did when you were in the theater.

  When it comes to feeding the frenzy, this 8 disc series is definitely one to fill the appetite of the Potter occult. From start to finish, Potter grows in his powers and of course, uses them to battle evil which serves all those he loves so much. While this basic 8 disc series has no ""special extras,"" it still has the full story line and if that's what you want, it's certainly what you'll get!

The complete movies are definitely 5 stars but this set with missing scenes is 1 star; thus, the 3 star rating. So very, very disappointed -- surely somebody has full versions???

  I bought this set because it was the most reasonably priced box set for my 8 Weeks of Harry Potter movie marathon.  I was a little shocked when I put in Disc 1 and discovered that I was not watching Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone... I was watching Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.  Not a big deal, but the page should probably include something that says this is the British version, as I expected the U.S. version since I was shopping on the U.S. Amazon site.

  BEWARE This is a scam, I bought ""Harry Potter: Complete 8-Film Collection GIFTSET DVD + Blu-ray"" The first thing:  It doesn't come with DVD's. Why is still listed that way? I don't get it.  I returned it and the second time came again without the DVD's so NOT GIFT SET AT ALL.The second thing: The Blu Rays are cheaply made and the volume is barely audible. My TV volume was in 70 and still was hard to hear.The third thing: Every movie is on one disk and in this set and the one I received has a  movie which said: ""DISK 1 MOVIE"" so this disk doesn't belong to this set. Still worst: I returned it and received back a set with the same disk what made me think: all the sets are altered or they sent me exactly the same set I sent back. Jeez...I have been back and forth with Amazon CS trying to get another set that what I bought and today I chat with:The worst: The Amazon's Customer Service representative Stephen V. who told me that what I can do is to buy the: ""Harry Potter: Hogwarts Collection Collector's Edition He said: ""The Multi Format Disc is different to Blu Ray, this dis contains 31 Discs, and a different manufacturer. It has 31 Discs."" Yes, is more expensive and ""I know this is frustrating, but this is the only option we have.I do apologize for the inconvenience.""WTH??? I have to pay $100 more because Amazon can't guarantee an item which is their AMAZON CHOICE??? It's really that difficult to follow up with a complaint like this which it's not the only one with the same problems: NO DVD, Cheapy Blu Rays and Volume trouble????.Have to say this time Amazon dropped the ball.

  I understand this isn't a ""collectors item box set"", but for someone who's obsessive about Harry Potter [whether it be only book based, or movie based, OR BOTH] I would recommend purchasing this set. My only conflict with the set is that the fourth movie [Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire] was damaged and I was unable to watch it. It's terribly sad, considering that The Goblet of Fire is my favorite movie out of all eight, but it's 100% okay because my friend went to Walmart and purchased a new one for me [for only 2$!]. But for the price of this set, you can't honestly assume something like that is completely unlikely. Either way, purchase this set for all fans! No matter what age!

  So, Harry Potter is a mixed bag for me, and I found that other people who say they are not ""into it"" is because they didn't bother to watch all of it.  The main reason?  PARTS 1 and 2 almost single handedly destroy this series.  The effects are cheap looking, like a BBC TV show, the story is dragging and very kiddy.  It just doesn't appeal much to those who are wondering why the rest of the world loves this series.  However, I always tell everyone to get those out of the way (yes watch them) and parts 3 and up really start to ramp up the series.  This collection is superb, even better when you have a high end TV that can accurately reproduce the darker scenes without losing quality.  As a bluray, 5 STARS.  As an overall package 4 starts because parts 1 and 2 aren't that good.

  This Christmas the whole family was down with colds and didn't feel like going or doing anything.  So we watched all eight of the movies in this set. The thrilling visuals and great surround sound gave us a good movie experience and the DVDs played flawlessly and looked and sounded great. That was 20 hours of great entertainment and we all enjoyed it. For the Harry Potter experience at a reasonable price this was a real bargain.

  Seriously! This Harry Potter after all, what would there be not like? This would make a wonderful weekend marathon affair where each participant would be muggle-born but magically inspired. But even if viewed separately, it enhances the book versions so well you could easily find yourself looking for the Leaky Cauldron and Platform Nine and Three Quarters.

  All 8 dvd's work fine. Quality appears to be good.The only let down for me, is that I waited a long time to order the series hoping they would give me the extended versions. I have watched all of the movies on television. Often they are the extended version, with several scenes not usually shown.So I feel sort of empty not receiving the extra scenes I'v watched on television.

  Very excited to watch all of the Harry Potter movies, everything was great until the 6th movie. The disc skipped about an hour in, it wouldn't play the rest of the movie. Tried on other blue ray player with same outcome. Very disappointed.

  All the blu-rays were in it. But the case it came in was smashed and broken. Had to manually check every disc to make sure they would play. They did. Reason for 3 stars is have to buy a new 8 disc holder because the old one arrived smashed. Other than that it was delivered very fast 2 days.

  Big fan of the HP movies, but I was waiting for the price of this collection to come down.  When it did during the Holiday season I jumped on it.Be aware, however, that these discs (for the most part) contain only the films.  I hardly watch the Special Features sections of movies anyway so this was not a problem for me.  Also be aware that the discs are from the ""Individual collections.""  In other words this set, is a bundle of Bluray discs stripped from the individual editions that were released and then compiled into this set.  That's why The Half Blood Prince cd has ""Disc 1"" printed on it, even though it's the 6th movie.  Do not expect 8 newly pressed discs for this edition.

  There are a lot of people that have rated this as a one star box set for its lack of special features and special packaging, rightfully so. However, $98 is a bit of a dream price to pay for 8 DVD's in a special package.For the money, this is an excellent set, with great quality picture (DVD at least) that can be watched over and over and over. My girlfriend is an avid Harry Potter fan and will undoubtedly watch all the discs until they are all too scratched to read. Personally, that's what I think this set is for. If you're looking for a collector's item then hold out, but if you just want to watch the movies, then don't pass this up

  I don't know if this is true for all of these or just some of them, but almost all of our discs in the set had smudges on them that affected playback. We've had several discs skip, which seems to be an issue with the disc itself and not due to a scratch or smudge. One of the extras discs with the Half-Blood Prince doesn't even play. It comes up with an error message saying the disc isn't supported, when in fact it should be. My husband and I bought this collection for all of the extra content, and we can't even watch all of it.

It comes up with an error message saying the disc isn't supported, when in fact it should be. My husband and I bought this collection for all of the extra content, and we can't even watch all of it.

  Is there anything more to say?  Sorry, but the only reason to not purchase these movies is if you did not like the books.  Which, if you read the books, you liked them. How many people don't like the books? Zero! So buy the movies!

  Great series.  If you've not watched it or read the books, it is something the whole family can enjoy.  Gets a little dark near the end of the series though.No issues with the disks. Didn't notice any difference in movie content between the American version and British version.  I think it's supposed to be a dialog difference.2 disks per case, standard case sizes (not thin pack). Deathly hallows case is a little wider as it contains 4 discs.

  We had looked everywhere for all 8 Harry Potter movies prior to finding them on Amazon, and they were considerably more expensive no matter where we looked. We were thrilled with the price, the product when delivered and the very fast delivery that we received. All around great experience.

  My wife is a huge fan of the series,  so I had to gets this as soon as I heard about it.  We had most of the movies on DVD.  Blu Ray is another being entirely,  the picture is awesome,  the sound,  all encompassing.  The way they are meant to be seen.

  To be clear, I am rating the 8 film Blu-ray box with only the 8 movies and no extras. It is obvious to me that this isn't a genuine box set but rather a ""top quality"" boot-leg. I'll list the issues I have with this set.1. ""The Half-Blood Prince"" is labeled ""DISC 1"" - As in there should have been more discs. I think what this boot-leg copy did was steal the artwork from the larger, more complete collection.2. There are no menus or set-up options on the movies, another sign that this set is illegitimate.3. While the first 7 movies played fine without a hitch, the last movie didn't play at all. It was stuck in a loading ""loop"" when inserted into my player. There was no damage or scratches on the disc. I did clean it but alas, it would not play. I would normally accept the first two problems as I am not particularly fastidious with these sorts of things. However, I do not believe that any legitimate box set would experience these problems. If you read the other one star reviews you will see similar if not worse problems. Hopefully you are smarter than I was before purchasing this set and I - along with the other one star reviews - can save you some heart-ache.

  Having gotten this collection on a Black Friday markdown to about $35, I'd say that this is a good deal for all eight movies in this series on Blu-Ray. The quality is good, although there is a slight glitch in The Sorcerer's Stone where the video gets messed up during a transition in the flying keys section near the end. Being that I'm only recently interested in Harry Potter, I enjoyed all eight movies, though I think The Sorcerer's Stone and The Chamber Of Secrets are the best since they reflect the childlike wonder of being in that kind of universe and are probably the most fun of the series.

  I was disappointed in this product because when I received it in the mail the plastic casing around the DVD's was completely shattered. When I opened the broken DVD casing all of the disks were loose because the inside of the case was cracked and broken off. There was no bubble wrap or any type of protective material in the thin envelope to prevent this from happening.I had purchased this film collection as a gift, and had to remove the DVD's and put them in individual sleeves. It is unknown to me at this time if any of the DVD's were damaged.

  Movies 1-5 all had no previews and went right into the film, but movies 6-8 had previews. Movie 6, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" actually said ""Disc 1"" on the Blu Ray CD almost like they pulled it out of the individual Blu Ray of the Half-Blood Prince insteat of making a special disc for these 8 movie set. Very strange.  The movies are fantastic and the box and jewel case are nice.  Just a little disappointing to get a ""pieced together"" feeling on the discs themselves.

  Best family movies ever! My kids are six and eight years old, and we watch the first two movies with both of them. My daughter, unfortunately, played the third movie for her brother when my husband fell asleep! When he woke, he just assumed that the movie that was playing was the same one he had set up.... He didn’t sit and watch with them and he has never watched a full Harry Potter movie! The movies get darker in subject material as Harry grows up. My eight year old daughter could have handled it when she was four. My son, on the other hand, had nightmares for a week.The books are rare gems, but the movies are very special as well.

Also, disc 1-5, 7-8 came with a bootleg menu. My dvd copies had more interactive title screens. Disc 6 actually came with menu but the disc look entirely out of sync with the others. The sleeve it came in looked used. And yes I did order this through Amazon and not a 3rd party sleller. It looks to be bootlegged. And I won't be ordering movies off of here again. So be advised.

  This is a great way to get all 8 of the Harry Potter films for an incredibly low price. The case that the movies come in is not made of the sturdiest materials, but that is hardly even worth mentioning. The movies themselves are perfect, and I love that they take up less space in our DVD stand. If you want a collectors item or a lot of extra features, you probably will want to purchase a different set, but if you just want to be able to enjoy the movies, I wouldn't pass this one up.

I don't know it was just me or is a very bad quality. At least it is a box inside another box. So I can close it with that.

  Overall I was very happy with this product. I brought it for my girlfriend for Christmas and she loved it. My only two complaints was that there aren't a lot of bonus features on the DVDs and when I received my DVD box set the part inside that allows you to rotate through the disks was broken making it hard to close. I didn't want to rate it to low though because it serves its purpose.

  The discs play great. That's all that matters, but the case is designed to hold all 8 movies. They are not individually packaged. So if you want to loan one to a friend, you have to give them the disc without a case. Next time I'll spend a little more and get the box set.

There was a piece broken in my case when it arrived, not sure if it broke in transit or was broken before, but it gives you an idea of how the case isn't the highest quality.

  Definitely good quality for the price that it was. Keep in mind the movies are just standard edition, so you won't get much extras or extended versions, but it's still good to have all the movies in one place. There was a piece broken in my case when it arrived, not sure if it broke in transit or was broken before, but it gives you an idea of how the case isn't the highest quality. Still happy with the product though and the case was easy to fix.

But when opening the bluray box came blue pieces of the same bluray box that was broken, luckily the discs were intact and did not suffer any damage. This is my only complaint and I recommend Amazon to make an inquiry to the product before sending it and to be careful when transporting it to its destination.

  We have enjoyed having all of the Harry Potter series. We were just saying that it was nice to not have to not wait for the next part of the story.  We have been watching one per night, and that works. Since there is not much on TV that we like it is nice to have a series of movies that we have paid big bucks to see. We like all of the extras, such as interviews and deleted scenes that are included.  It is also fun to see the actors who start out quite young and get older as the story progresses. There seems to be more than I remember.  At any rate this is a good series to have.

  We bought this for Christmas, so we didn't watch them in time to correct the problem with the order. Of course the movies are great, it was the DVD selection that's the problem. When customers buy DVDs, they automatically assume the DVDs are for home use, not the ones bought to rent to people. Now we're stuck with ten minutes of trailers for other movies coming out at the time each individual Harry Potter movie was released, along with a commericial for the Harry Potter game associated with that particular movie (or the still-hasn't-opened-website ""Pottermore."") ""Coming soon to a theatre near you"" or ""Coming soon on DVD"" fills a good ten minutes of our time, before the actual movie starts. Worse yet, there is no pause between the coming attractions (now all old movies) and the start of the movie, so we're stuck hoping we don't have to watch every single commericial, while waiting for the movie to start.This is from Amazon, not from a third party, but apparently even Amazon was in such a rush to get this ""8-film collection"" out in time for Christmas, so they cheated on which movies to send. I can only assume when the ""Collection Set"" comes out, they will do a better job, but after this I recommend not to trust Amazon for their movies.If you don't want the same problem, make sure you check your DVDs, when they first arrive. Heaven forbid, you give these knock offs as a present to someone a month or so later - you're stuck with them, because it's too late to return them. Always check Amazon movies for this problem immediately.

  I read a lot of negative reviews on this but ignored those opinions and went ahead and made the purchase.My background:I have been a potter head for half my life and have quite a collection of potter garb. I couldn't afford the Wizard collection and when I saw this, I thought it to be a steal. If you are like me, after many Potter thons your dvds are scratched and worn down. This seemed perfect to not only replace my old dvds but give me blue ray and digital copies as well.Quick Math:Blue ray collection ~ $65Dvd Collection ~ $40So for these collections which include no special features when bought in bulk nor do they come with the virtual copy. If this is what you want then you shouldnt even be considering the Hogwarts collection.If you want all this with all the features and didgital versions, you are looking at `$25 per movie. This would bring you to a little over $200.With this you would also not get all the special features worth your while like ""Creating the world of Harry Potter"" and the bonus disc which is incredible.So in my opinion, this actually gives you more bang for your buck.Now ignoring money but focusing on the content. I have watched all the special features from start to finish and I think that these features are probably my favorite piece of my potter collection. If you have grown up with these kids like I have it is an emotional documentary of the series and what the actors and actresses have gone through.For all the negative reviews complaining about this collection, I would have to disagree with them because i believe there is a lot of gold material in this that you wont experience anywhere else.

  Very much enjoying my Hogwarts film fest. All the movies are here, complete. No frills. Simple DVD version, in a single box. Sometimes the simple things are the best. This is one of those times.

  I did not have any of the Harry Potter movies in my possession and was looking for a complete collection that didn't cost an arm and a leg, and this fit my qualifications perfectly. If you want ""the"" Harry Potter movie collection this isn't it, but if you're like me and just want the movies and aren't interested in any of the extras than this works just fine. All the DVDs are in one plastic case that seems fairly durable and which was stuck inside a cardboard sleeve that I went ahead and just tossed. I've watched four of the movies so far and haven't had any trouble getting them to play or any related problems of that nature. No problems with delivery or packaging either. All in all a big thumbs up.

  When I inserted the disc my playstation 4 took very long to read it.  Once I played the movie, there were no sound or visual quality of blu-ray standards.  It actually looked like a bootleg.  I had my stereo system at a level I've never had it, because it would be too loud, yet I was just able to hear it.  When I tried to request a refund, it said that it was not eligible for one.  I just blew my money on this.  I've never had an issue with buying videos before through Amazon but I will no longer do so, for fear of it being a bootleg and I can't even get my money back.  Do not purchase this item, if you read the reviews like I SHOULD have, there are others leaving similar comments.  It's way too expensive, I could have gotten a bootleg for much cheaper than this!

  There are important elements which need to be present in order to make a movie (or a book) engaging. The Harry Potter series has those elements, the most important of which is engaging, believable characters and character interaction. You feel for these people and what they endure. It also has another tremendously important element -- a good plot, a well-developed story. Many people, of my acquaintance, have criticized this series because of the inclusion of magic. To me, the magic is a secondary part of the most important story -- the crisis facing Harry and his friends, and their determination to overcome evil.

  I have purposely not bought a single HP film. Why? Because I knew that a box set would come out. And now one has come out. And it is exactly what I want - the complete set of films. According to the photos provided, there are extras/additional scenes to the first five films. And that is a good thing. I will be interested to see how long it takes for other versions of the complete set to come out. And maybe they will be so great that I will consider purchasing those. Or maybe WB will pull a George Lucas on us . . . Either way, I am happy to see a set come out with the theatrical versions - versions that I fell in love with at the movies. Versions I will continue to love watching many years from now. Can't wait till this comes out.

Two were loose in the case when it arrived, and at least one falls out every time we open the case. The 8th movie is already ruined. I've moved the rest to other DVD cases in an attempt to save them, but this is not worth the money with the case being so defective.  I didn't even notice the 8th movie was broken until after the return window expired. It could have been DOA.

  This is the most ridiculous and horrible bootleg thing I have ever bought from amazon. The first time I ordered was for a Christmas present for my fiance and when we went to watch the first year it was missing and instead we had TWO year 3. So amazon sent me a replacement, we get all the way to the very end of Deathly Hollows part 2 where Voldemort and Harry are in battle and it freeze and skips to the very end 19 years later. I can't believe amazon would sell something like this. It was bad enough that some of the DVDs cover don't match as well as some of the print on them look wonky but now I have to take time out of my schedule to send back this crap again and I still won't have the dvd collection because I refuse to buy it from this horrible seller!

  I’m a bit annoyed.... I finally broke down and purchased this boxed set for my kids (I’m not a HP fan, but my kids are) they were so excited!!! The order arrives and it has two of the same dvd in it and missing one...(I forget which one) so I do a return and replacement order. Amazon was quick to send the replacement and the return was easier than I thought, UPS came with a label and picked up the box!!The replacement comes and though all the dvds are correct, the case was broken, a chunk of plastic was broken off, so it won’t close properly and stay closed.... I could tell my perfectionist daughter was disappointed, but I told her I’m not going through the replacement/return process again... so we have all the correct dvds with a stinkin’ broken case....Two stars because amazon was quick to replace, but I’m still disappointed and annoyed!!!!

I have only watched the first 2 but I hear the 5th disc is the worst, a snapshot of the book.  This makes sense because it is a large book and one of the shortest movies.. Disappointing at best.

  When I first saw they had a DVD collection of all 8 films of the Harry Potter Franchise I instantly jump to buy this set. It may not have a lot of special features but I figured it wouldn't since all 8 films are in this collection. Hours before I bought this I went to Target and saw they had this exact same item for $75. I was glad I bought this because it saved me a lot of money. Overall this is a great DVD collection of the Harry Potter movies.

  I love books and the films! My favorite part about the Blu-Ray set is the ability to see all of the deleted scenes, which are usually parts from the book that were cut.

Because I have seen the first movie so much, I don't mind, but it is still the reason this product doesn't get a full five stars.

  I ordered this for Christmas in a featured deal.  The back of the discs are gold, you can see all the wording on the front of the disc, as if they are too thin. We attempted to play a disc (#5) and it would freeze and skip, over 10 times in the first 8 minutes before I gave up. Amazon was kind enough to replace it.  Replacement arrived and we settled in to finally watch our movie. The player wouldn't even recognize them this time. Other Blurays and DVDs play fine, none of these would play at all.

  I'm actually very happy with my purchase.  The price is excellent compared to buying them individually.  I give it 4 stars out of 5.  My expectations were met.Every Harry Potter movie plays with no malfunctions.  Since I have a 5 and 8 year old who watch them over and over I no longer have to buy a one time play via the cable company or get the overused library movies.Be prepared that there is not one single ""extra"".  Each DVD has only the movie.Also be prepared for the cheaply made storage box.  It opens up like a old photo album with each hard plastic page holding two movies (front & back).  My 5 year old had it for less than a few minutes and broke it.  None of the movies were damaged but the ""pages"" didn't fit back into the box which was then difficult to close.  Maybe the Chinese could reengineer that storage box to once again hold the movies that came in it but my family is unable to.The poor made storage box is actually the only reason I did not rate this product 5 stars.  I read the reviews and mostly knew only to expect the movies and they work so I am mostly satisfied.

Not just whenever they are on tv or whichever movies they decide to air. I am not a collector, therefore this set is perfect for me.

  I bought this set for my 14-year old daughter for Christmas and she loved it! It is a no-frills collection and that is why the price is great. The movies are each in their own plastic case and all the cases connect. Very convenient and this way all the movies are kept together in one place. Very happy I bought this set.

  The movies are very good and highly entertaining.  We have certainly enjoyed them.  However, when I opened the box, I noticed a rattling sound that was rather disturbing.  The outer plastic case containing the DVDs was broken, as well as the hinges on the media caddies.  Fortunately the DVDs were unharmed, but it did give us pause for concern.  Our daughter, for whom the product was purchased, chose to keep them rather than have us send them back.

It is a great way to escape reality without violence that is too much for my childs age or just too much in general.  The movie has substance so it did not need sex and violence as much.  So as a mom it is a good option for growing little ones.  my son has read and reread the books as well he is nine.

It's a basic case with the 8 standard edition films in it. No real extras are to be found. So if you are looking for the special editions with a variety of special features and collectors items then this is absolutely not for you. If you are satisfied with a compact collection of just the movies then this is going to satisfy the majority of buyers.

  This is an excellent way to get all the SE of Harry Potter in an affordable package.  At least more afordable than the Wizard's Collection.  While the package is beautiful, it is a bit flimsy and probably won't survive the long term.  One wrong move or a over excited child and it will fall apart.  And to everyone bemoaning the lack of extended cuts, Cuaron has always said his theatrical cut is his directors cut.  All the extra footage cut is not necessary.

  I have been a fan of Harry Potter since just before the first film came out. I mom and I went and saw EVERY movie together and we read all the books. I'm so sad it's over but at least I can watch it over and over again. The only issue is that I can't play it on an American DVD player.

This collection is great for those out there that want to own the films without paying a bunch of money or sifting through all the special features. All 8 DVD's are placed in a slim plastic case and are firmly placed. This is both affordable and durable. I highly recommend this product.

  Harry Potter has never looked better. Even the older films (HPatSS & HPatCoS) look excellent in Blu-ray formatting. The extras get a little redundant but having all these films in one bundle is a must have for HP fans!

  I have long been a proponent of Blu-ray and DVD even while others have moved to digital but these discs may be what pushes me forever away from physical formats. I bought these several months ago and just got to watching them and EVERY disc is riddled with playback problems. From small skips, to stopping to outright not working the quality of the discs are terrible. The movies of course are great even if this compilation doesn't include many extras but check to see if your discs are working. This has actually happened to me a few times with Amazon purchases now so I'd strongly suggest reviewing these discs right away so you can replace them if they are bad.

  I wish I could give this NO STARS.  How careless I was not to read the reviews of this item.  When I saw it had almost 5 stars compared to the 1.6 stars for The Wizard's Collection, I purchased it.  When we watched the first movie and got to the scene where Hagrid comes to rescue Harry from the island his uncle and aunt take him too we were wondering where the full scene was. We have it on the DVD we bought years ago, but now have Blu Ray.  Then we found other extended scenes were missing.

  I wish I could give this NO STARS.  How careless I was not to read the reviews of this item.  When I saw it had almost 5 stars compared to the 1.6 stars for The Wizard's Collection, I purchased it.  When we watched the first movie and got to the scene where Hagrid comes to rescue Harry from the island his uncle and aunt take him too we were wondering where the full scene was. We have it on the DVD we bought years ago, but now have Blu Ray.  Then we found other extended scenes were missing.

  Having first read all 7 of the Novels by J. K. Rowling from ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" to ""The Deathly Hallows"" BEFORE watching the 8 DVDs, I observed: (1) All 8 movies are highly entertaining and did a good job of following the basic plots of the books; (2) There were several times, especially in the later movies, that excessive special effects, violence, and drama were added to the screenplays taking time and valuable substance from the actual plots: and (3) I was disappointed at the end of ""Deathly Hallows"" part 2, that Harry simply throws the elder wand away over the side of the bridge.  It was so nicer in the book when he used the elder wand to properly mend his own wand (which he felt great renewed attachment to), then leave the elder wand in Dumbledore's office where It could do no further harm.

  I was so excited when this came. The insert that holds the blue ray's is a little bit sketchy but nothing to fret over. I was very impressed with all of the features that came on most of the discs. The Deathly Hallows did not have these additional features and it seemed like the menus on these discs didn't 'mesh' with the way the others were set up but overall I am very happy! It arrived in about a week with the free shipping and was packaged nicely.

  when my product arrived, I was given the British version of the series instead of the American one shown, and a letter telling me how much better this version was. So I researched it to find that the British version is 10 to 15 dollars cheaper. In the letter I mentioned earlier, he offered a ten dollar gift card that he conveniently didn't send. It was shady and a hassle and you should do what you say you will. Will avoid this seller at all costs. Product is great.
